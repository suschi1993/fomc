      "Survey measures of individuals' expectations of future labor market conditions improved in November, largely reversing post-Katrina declines. Although high profit margins could imply some existing pricing power, they might also provide a cushion to absorb some future cost increases. Consumer price inflation remained elevated in April and May, reflecting sharp rises in energy prices and more rapid increases in core prices. Spending on cars and light trucks increased somewhat in July after a lackluster pace in the second quarter but apparently weakened in August. The Manager also discussed with the Committee the results of a recent review of the management of the domestic security holdings of the SOMA. Higher imports of capital goods excluding aircraft, computers, and semiconductors and of oil also contributed to the overall gain in imports. TIPS-based inflation compensation at the five-year horizon was about unchanged, while inflation compensation at longer horizons crept higher. Moreover, participants noted that many capital expenditures were internally financed, making them less sensitive to credit market conditions. Many readings from the business sector were also softer: Industrial production fell in October, as did orders and shipments of capital goods. After showing some signs of improvement in late September and October, conditions in financial markets worsened over the intermeeting period. Debt in the domestic nonfinancial sector was estimated to be increasing somewhat more slowly in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar against major currencies declined slightly, on balance, over the intermeeting period. Participants discussed the possibility that these developments could lead to an excessive pull-back in credit availability and in investment. The Committee agreed on the need to act in a timely manner to promote its dual objectives of sustainable economic growth and price stability. Incoming data suggested further slowing elsewhere in emerging Asia, and second-quarter activity appeared to have remained sluggish in Mexico. Credit outstanding under the Federal Reserve's Term Auction Facility (TAF) increased to about $448 billion because of expanded auction sizes. The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability. Participants generally agreed that purchasing such securities could be a useful adjunct to other monetary policy tools in some circumstances. Orders and shipments for many types of equipment declined in October and November, and imports of capital goods dropped back in those months. The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability. Both exports and imports retreated significantly in the fourth quarter of last year and appeared headed for comparable declines this quarter. During the intermeeting period, foreign authorities took additional steps to address the weaknesses in their economies and financial systems. The Committee voted unanimously to amend paragraph 3 of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations with the text underlined below. The staff also provided the Committee with an analysis of the potential adverse effects of very high reserve balances on bank capital ratios. CDS spreads for banking organizations declined considerably over the intermeeting period, although they remained well above historical norms. As a result, corporate bond spreads narrowed further and dropped below the previous peak levels reached in 2002 following the 2001 recession. Participants discussed the extent to which the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet would affect inflation expectations going forward. Recent data on new orders and shipments pointed to an earlier bottoming out in equipment and investment spending than previously anticipated. As previously announced, the Federal Reserve's purchases of $300 billion of Treasury securities will be completed by the end of October 2009. Although consumer spending on motor vehicles declined in September after the expiration of government rebates, other household spending rose. In the much smaller multifamily sector, where tight credit conditions persisted and vacancies remained elevated, starts were about unchanged. In the near term, most participants anticipated that substantial slack in both labor and product markets would likely keep inflation subdued. Real spending on equipment and software was estimated to have risen slightly in the third quarter after falling sharply for more than a year. and three-month maturities were about flat; spreads at the six-month maturity narrowed somewhat further but remained above pre-crisis levels. Imports of oil accounted for roughly one-third of the increase in total imports, though most other categories of imports also recorded gains. However, real spending on drilling and mining structures increased strongly in response to the earlier rebound in oil and natural gas prices. Based on this outlook, members agreed that it would be appropriate to maintain the target range of 0 to 쩌 percent for the federal funds rate. The U.S. international trade deficit widened sharply in May, as a significant increase in exports was more than offset by a surge in imports. Moreover, average weekly hours of all employees were little changed, on net, in recent months after rising during the first half of the year. Household net worth rose further in the third quarter, as an increase in equity values more than offset the effect of a drop in house prices. Residential mortgage rates rose considerably over the intermeeting period, though not by as much as rates on longer-term Treasury securities. Despite the steep run-up in agricultural commodity prices over the second half of last year, increases in retail food prices remained modest. The ratios of yields on long-term general obligation bonds to those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities moved up to a very high level. However, credit conditions remained tight for smaller, bank-dependent firms, although bank loan growth had clearly picked up in some sectors. In addition, dealers reported an increase in leverage over the past six months by hedge funds that pursue a variety of investment strategies. Several participants noted that even large commodity price increases have had only limited effects on underlying inflation in recent decades. Liquid deposits, the largest component of M2, advanced at a solid pace likely reflecting very low opportunity costs of holding such deposits. In assessing the economic outlook, participants judged that strains in global financial markets continued to pose significant downside risks. Some participants, however, saw persistent slack in resource utilization as weighting the risks to the outlook for inflation to the downside. The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons remained large, and the rate of long-duration unemployment continued to be high. The expected path of the federal funds rate based on money market futures was little changed between the September and October FOMC meetings. Real federal government purchases appeared to decrease further in January and February, as defense spending continued to contract on balance. The staff also reported on potential risks to financial stability, including those associated with the current low interest rate environment. As a result, vigilance on the part of policymakers and regulators was warranted, especially in light of episodic strains in European markets. A range of views was expressed regarding the economic and labor market conditions that would call for an adjustment in the pace of purchases. In Japan, where recent policy measures appeared to have boosted household confidence, economic growth picked up noticeably early in the year. The rise in longer-term Treasury yields appeared to reflect both an increase in term premiums and a rise in expected future short-term rates. However, some others commented that any adverse effects of the increase in rates on financial conditions more broadly appeared to be limited. In the view of one member, the progress to date in labor markets and in broader economic conditions amply supported a reduction in purchases. Year-to-date issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) remained strong, but far below levels seen before the financial crisis. Labor market conditions had improved in recent months, with monthly gains in payroll employment of more than 200,000 in October and November. B. Maintain reciprocal currency arrangements with foreign central banks in accordance with the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations. It was also noted that recent developments in several emerging market economies, if they continued, could pose downside risks to the outlook. Imports also rose in January as the increase in the volume of oil imports more than offset declines in imports of non-oil goods and services. Contacts in several Districts pointed to plans for increasing capital expenditures or to stronger demand for commercial and industrial loans. Mortgage credit conditions generally remained tight, though further incremental signs of easing emerged amid continued gains in house prices. Starts and permits of both new single-family homes and multifamily units were higher in July than their average levels in the second quarter. In the leveraged loan market, institutional issuance slowed some in September, though investors' interest in the asset class remained strong. Household spending was rising moderately and business fixed investment was advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow. Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated. Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated. B. Maintain reciprocal currency arrangements with foreign central banks in accordance with the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations. Credit flows to nonfinancial firms generally remained strong through the last quarter of 2014, though they slowed somewhat for riskier firms. Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased in the first quarter, albeit at a much slower pace than in the fourth quarter of 2014. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. The foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar increased during the intermeeting period against the currencies of major U.S. trading partners. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. The rate of private-sector job openings declined in August but was still at a high level, while the rates of hiring and quits were unchanged. But this decline was balanced by subsequent appreciation, in part as expectations increased for greater monetary policy accommodation abroad. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have edged down. B. Maintain reciprocal currency arrangements with foreign central banks in accordance with the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations. In many foreign economies, real GDP growth in the fourth quarter appeared to continue at a pace roughly similar to that in the third quarter. Spreads on commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) continued to widen, on net, despite the narrowing of spreads in broader bond markets. A number of factors likely contributed to the improvement, including expectations of more accommodative monetary policy in the United States. The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed substantially in March, with a sharp decline in imports more than offsetting a fall in exports. Foreign real GDP growth picked up in the first quarter, supported by relatively robust increases in Canada, the euro area, Japan, and Mexico. Spreads of 10-year triple-B-rated corporate bond yields over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities were little changed on balance. The sharp rebound in payroll employment gains put the average monthly increase in jobs over the three months ending in June at about 150,000. Members saw developments during the intermeeting period as reducing near-term uncertainty along two dimensions discussed at the June meeting. However, members emphasized that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Managing balances in various time and other deposit accounts at foreign institutions approved by the Board of Governors under Regulation N.C. While outstanding commercial and industrial loans and CP both declined somewhat in August, gross issuance of corporate bonds was quite large. However, members emphasized that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. However, members emphasized that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Market expectations for an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at the December meeting rose over the intermeeting period. However, members emphasized that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Managing balances in various time and other deposit accounts at foreign institutions approved by the Board of Governors under Regulation N.C. Market participants continued to report substantial uncertainty about potential changes in fiscal, regulatory, and other government policies. Domestic financial conditions were mostly little changed, on balance, since the December FOMC meeting. Mining output expanded further following a large gain in the fourth quarter, and manufacturing production continued to rise at a modest pace. Members agreed that the federal funds rate was likely to remain, for some time, below levels that they expected to prevail in the longer run. The rate of private-sector job openings increased in March and April, while the quits rate was little changed and the hiring rate moved down. And many business contacts in the affected areas reported that they expected their operations to return to normal before the end of the year. Managing balances in various time and other deposit accounts at foreign institutions approved by the Board of Governors under Regulation N.C. In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), real GDP in the euro area and the United Kingdom expanded at a moderate pace in the fourth quarter. In emerging market economies (EMEs), sovereign yield spreads widened modestly, and flows into EME mutual funds were volatile over the period. Members agreed that inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to run near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term. Members agreed that the federal funds rate was likely to remain, for some time, below levels that they expected to prevail in the longer run. Real GDP was forecast to increase in the second half of this year at a pace that was just a little slower than in the first half of the year. Turkey and Argentina experienced significant stress, and other countries with similar macroeconomic vulnerabilities also came under pressure. Many participants noted that the recent pace of aggregate wage gains was broadly consistent with trends in productivity growth and inflation. Managing balances in various time and other deposit accounts at foreign institutions approved by the Board of Governors under Regulation N.C. Data on nominal business expenditures for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector in November were not available. Staff continued to monitor developments in the leveraged loan market given the sharp rise in spreads and slowdown in issuance late last year. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed in recent months and remained generally supportive of household spending. Economy-wide wage growth was seen as being broadly consistent with recent rates of labor productivity growth and with inflation of 2 percent. According to the April SLOOS, commercial banks left lending standards for auto loans and other consumer loans unchanged in the first quarter. Participants widely noted that the global developments that led to the heightened uncertainties about the economic outlook were quite recent. In consumer credit markets, financing conditions were little changed in recent months and remained generally supportive of consumer spending. Some participants observed that trade uncertainties had receded somewhat, especially with the easing of trade tensions with Mexico and China. The strong June employment report suggested that the weak May payroll figures were not a precursor to a more material slowdown in job growth. The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through mid-October remained near historically low levels. The average pace of job gains over the three months ending in November, which is unaffected by the strike, was stronger than earlier in 2019. Managing balances in various time and other deposit accounts at foreign institutions approved by the Board of Governors under Regulation N.C. In addition, these tools are not within the authority of the Committee, and their use requires coordination with other prudential regulators. The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through mid-January remained near historically low levels. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained at 2 percent in November. Nominal wage growth remained moderate, as average hourly earnings for all employees increased 3.1 percent over the 12 months ending in March. The EFFR fluctuated between 8 and 10 basis points, and the SOFR fluctuated between 7 and 13 basis points, throughout the intermeeting period. Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE), particularly those in capital markets, recovered further over the intermeeting period. In contrast, conditions in the auto loan market appeared to be little changed, on balance, with those for subprime borrowers remaining tight. In addition, participants noted that it was appropriate that the Desk would continue to offer large-scale overnight and term repo operations. The pound was little changed, as some of its earlier appreciation against the dollar unwound amid a resurgence of Brexit-related uncertainty. In particular, participants reiterated their commitment to achieve maximum employment and an inflation rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Managing balances in various time and other deposit accounts at foreign institutions approved by the Board of Governors under Regulation N.C. Progress on vaccinations had been slower than expected, and the near-term trajectory of the pandemic worsened, weighing on economic activity. Interest rates on new credit card offers for nonprime borrowers stayed elevated, and financing conditions remained tight for those borrowers. Members also remarked that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus, including progress on vaccinations. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 and the VIX declined, approaching the median level observed in the decade before the pandemic. Members also remarked that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus, including progress on vaccinations. Participants agreed that they would continue their discussion of design parameters for both a domestic SRF and a standing FIMA repo facility. A number of participants noted that the labor market recovery continued to be uneven across demographic and income groups and across sectors. The July SLOOS also indicated that the level of standards on C&I loans returned to the easier end of the range that had prevailed since 2005. In addition, the accumulated stock of savings and further progress on vaccination were cited as important factors lifting household spending. Some other participants emphasized that recent high inflation readings had largely been driven by price increases in a handful of categories. They also agreed to remove the word \"significantly\" when characterizing the dependence of the path of the economy on the course of the virus. These impairments were concentrated in the retirement and assisted living sector and represent a very small fraction of the municipal market. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months, but the rise in COVID-19 cases has slowed their recovery. Although real state and local purchases increased, the gain was largely offset by declines in both federal defense and nondefense purchases. Managing balances in various time and other deposit accounts at foreign institutions approved by the Board of Governors under Regulation N.C. Some other participants noted that monthly caps for Treasury securities should take into consideration potential risks to market functioning. Most major foreign central banks were proceeding on a path of removing policy accommodation in order to address elevated levels of inflation. Japanese yields and equity prices, however, ended the period about unchanged, as the BOJ reaffirmed its accommodative monetary policy stance. The deputy manager turned first to a discussion of financial market developments. The 75 basis point increase in the target range at the June meeting passed through fully to the federal funds rate and other overnight rates. Credit availability for low-credit-score borrowers continued to ease through July but remained modestly tight and close to pre-pandemic averages. Equity prices fell sharply following the December FOMC statement but recovered over the remainder of the period in response to data releases. New home sales reached a new high in October, and existing home sales eased off only a little from the high levels recorded during the summer. Ongoing increases in home prices and additional gains in the stock market, however, further boosted household wealth during the first quarter. Real outlays for equipment and software surged in the first quarter after a relatively subdued performance in the fourth quarter of last year. At its March meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to raise its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4.75 percent. That cooling was especially noticeable for high-end homes and for houses in markets that previously had experienced the steepest appreciation. While the precise reasons for the increase in federal receipts were not entirely clear, robust income growth was probably an important factor. At its September meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to maintain its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent. Meanwhile, banks took measures to conserve their liquidity and were cautious about counterparties' exposures to asset-backed commercial paper. Although it decelerated in the third quarter, business-sector debt continued to advance at a solid pace, boosted by a surge in business loans. Inflation expectations seemed to be contained, and the less robust economic outlook implied somewhat less pressure on resources going forward. Small time deposits continued to expand, likely in part due to high rates offered by some depository institutions to attract retail deposits. In the forecast prepared for this meeting, the staff revised down its estimate of growth in aggregate economic activity in the fourth quarter. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.3. On average, private nonfarm payroll employment in November and December rose at only about half of the average pace seen from July to October. Moreover, a leveling-off of energy and commodity prices such as that embedded in futures markets would also help moderate inflation pressures. The available information suggested that the downside risks to growth had increased significantly since the time of the December FOMC meeting. Also, the continued fall in home prices and declines in equity prices were weighing on household wealth, with a depressing effect on spending. Conditions in short-term funding markets remained strained for most of the intermeeting period, though some signs of improvement were evident. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.3. Secondary market prices for leveraged loans stayed near record lows and the average bid-asked spread in that market continued to be very wide. All other members indicated that they thought it appropriate to continue the program of purchasing agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. Orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft fell in March, turning negative again after having been flat in February. The analysis also suggested that the market value of the Federal Reserve's securities holdings could decline appreciably under some scenarios. Meanwhile, the federal government issued large amounts of debt, and state and local government debt was estimated to have expanded moderately. The moderation in the pace of decline in industrial production in the second quarter was widespread across industries and major market groups. Indicators of Treasury market functioning were little changed over the intermeeting period, and functioning continued to be somewhat impaired. Credit default swap spreads for large bank holding companies were about flat, but they widened for regional and smaller banking organizations. Banks' securities holdings declined at a modest pace after several months of steady growth, and total loans on banks' books continued to drop. Inventories appeared to approach comfortable levels relative to sales in the aggregate, although inventory positions across industries varied. Survey measures of long-term inflation expectations were fairly stable in recent months at levels slightly lower than those posted a year ago. The core consumer price index rose only slightly over the period, and the year-over-year change in the index was lower than earlier this year. This retreat led to a broad appreciation of the dollar as well as declines in equity prices abroad and in yields on benchmark sovereign bonds. A few participants noted that economic recoveries were often uneven and were typically slow following downturns triggered by financial crises. In the third quarter, the modest rise in hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector was matched by a similar increase in productivity. The advanced foreign economies (AFEs) also saw a slower rise in real economic activity in the third quarter than occurred earlier in the year. Much of the fourth-quarter downswing was likely associated with a drawdown of motor vehicle stocks after an accumulation in the third quarter. Moreover, a number of participants expected that slack in resource utilization would continue to restrain increases in labor costs and prices. Several of them indicated, in light of recent developments, that the risks to their forecasts of inflation had shifted somewhat to the upside. Real federal purchases turned up in the second quarter, as defense expenditures rebounded after declining noticeably in the preceding quarter. Core commercial bank loans--the sum of commercial and industrial (C&I), real estate, and consumer loans--expanded slightly in July and August. In addition, retail investors evidently placed redemptions from equity and bond mutual funds into bank deposits and retail money market funds. Surveys suggested that households were pessimistic about their future incomes, and consumer confidence had dropped to historically low levels. However, real disposable income declined in the third quarter, as increases in consumer prices more than offset small gains in nominal income. Closed-end residential mortgage loans held by banks also increased amid the modest pickup in refinancing activity, while CRE loans contracted. It was also noted that the extended period of highly accommodative monetary policy could eventually lead to a buildup of financial imbalances. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.3. Average hourly earnings for all employees posted a moderate gain in December, and their rate of increase from 12 months earlier remained slow. Overall U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, rose at a somewhat faster rate in February than in the preceding six months. Against the background of these increased stresses within the euro area, foreign equity indexes declined and corporate credit spreads widened. Anecdotal evidence from business contacts indicated that activity in the energy and agriculture sectors continued to advance in recent months. Inflation has declined, mainly reflecting lower prices of crude oil and gasoline, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. In addition, numerical thresholds could be confused with the Committee's longer-term objectives, and so undermine the Committee's credibility. In their discussion of the household sector, many participants noted a recent drop in consumer sentiment and a softening in consumer spending. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.3. Manufacturing production increased briskly in November and December after declining in October when activity was disrupted by Hurricane Sandy. Starts of new single-family homes declined, on net, in April and May, but permits rose, suggesting gains in construction in the coming months. Growth in total bank credit moderated in April and May compared with the first quarter, as core loans slowed and securities declined slightly. Conditions in the labor market improved further as private payrolls rose at a solid pace in June, but the unemployment rate remained elevated. Moreover, maintaining the pace of purchases could be perceived as a sign that the FOMC had turned more pessimistic about the economic outlook. Gross issuance of nonfinancial corporate bonds and commercial paper, which had been particularly strong in September, slowed a bit in October. Yields on 20-year general obligation municipal bonds decreased about in line with other longer-term market rates over the intermeeting period. Inflation slowed recently in many advanced foreign economies, partly as a result of a deceleration in prices for energy and other commodities. The unemployment rate had declined but remained elevated when judged against members' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment. Household spending was rising moderately and business fixed investment was advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow. Starts of new single-family homes increased in December to their highest level since 2008, and permits for new construction also moved higher. The purchasing power of households' income continued to be supported by low energy prices, and real disposable income rose briskly in January. Regarding the most likely meeting date for the first rate increase, survey respondents were about evenly split between September and December. Such considerations also argued for increasing the target range for the federal funds rate gradually after policy normalization was under way. Market-based measures of inflation compensation moved lower; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products appeared to increase at a solid pace in the third quarter. Nonetheless, underwriting standards continued to be relatively loose, and financing conditions appeared to remain quite accommodative overall. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had edged down. Members also discussed their expectations for the size and timing of adjustments in the target range for the federal funds rate going forward. Households' net worth was supported by further strong gains in home values through November, although equity prices declined in recent months. Household and business spending had been increasing at moderate rates; however, net exports had been soft and inventory investment had slowed. Commercial and industrial loan growth at banks was also strong, mostly driven by the origination of large loans to investment-grade borrowers. Total real government purchases rose modestly in the first quarter and appeared to be increasing at about the same pace in the second quarter. Other participants continued to judge that labor utilization remained below that consistent with the Committee's maximum-employment objective. Participants agreed that the Committee should continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. Participants agreed that the Committee should continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. The revised proposal was based on further analysis and consultations following Committee discussion of a proposal at the January 2016 meeting. They pointed to the encouraging tone of recent data on economic growth abroad, which suggested some upside risks to foreign economic activity. Participants agreed that the Committee should continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. Several participants noted that rising orders for capital goods suggested further gains in business equipment investment over coming quarters. In this projection, the staff scaled back its assumptions regarding the magnitude and duration of fiscal policy expansion in the coming years. Gross issuance of institutional leveraged loans continued its robust pace in June but slowed notably in July, as is typical during the summer. The credit performance of bonds issued by, and loans extended to, nonfinancial corporations also remained strong over the intermeeting period. Meanwhile, growth of banks' commercial and industrial (C&I) loans continued to be sluggish, although it picked up a bit in the third quarter. Nonetheless, they reiterated that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period. Averaging through fluctuations associated with the recent hurricanes, job gains had been solid and the unemployment rate had declined further. The briefings noted several factors beyond those captured in the models that appeared to have put downward pressure on prices in recent years. The share of workers who were employed part time for economic reasons was little changed in December and was close to its pre-recession level. The VIX, an index of option-implied volatility for one-month returns on the S&P 500 index, increased but remained low by historical standards. Financial markets were turbulent over the intermeeting period, and market volatility increased notably. Judging from federal funds futures quotes, the expected path of the federal funds rate changed relatively little over the intermeeting period. Monthly data pointed to some improvement toward the end of the quarter, as real PCE moved up in March after declining in January and February. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and core inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, had remained near 2 percent. Participants noted that both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent on a 12-month basis. The decline in exports largely reflected lower exports of capital goods, while greater imports of industrial supplies boosted overall imports. Some participants commented that trade policy developments remained a source of uncertainty for the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. Bond yields in Germany and the United Kingdom fell, partly reflecting weaker-than-expected inflation data and European political developments. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and core inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, had remained near 2 percent. Some participants commented on the possibility of slowing the pace of the decline in reserves in approaching the longer-run level of reserves. Imports fell in January before edging a touch higher in February, with the average of the two months declining relative to the fourth quarter. Later in the period, the expected path of policy moved down, partly in response to incoming information pointing to a weaker economic outlook. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed. A couple of participants pointed out that establishing a standing facility would be similar to the practice of some other major central banks. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 2.9 percent over the 12 months ending in September, roughly similar to the pace a year earlier. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed. A few participants noted that the current weakness in capital expenditures could lead to a slower pace of productivity growth in future years. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed. Nominal wage growth was moderate, with average hourly earnings for all employees increasing 2.9 percent over the 12 months ending in December. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed. Conditions in short-term funding markets also deteriorated sharply amid a decline in market liquidity and challenges in dealer intermediation. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. The manager turned next to a discussion of financial market functioning, open market operations, and conditions in short-term funding markets. The evolving outlooks for the path of the virus and for fiscal policy were the main drivers of financial markets over the intermeeting period. In the Open Market Desk Survey of Primary Dealers, the median 2021 gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast rose about 1 percentage point. Commercial paper outstanding declined somewhat in late December but quickly rebounded in early January to the levels observed before year-end. Total PCE price inflation was 1.5 percent over the 12 months ending in January and continued to be held down by slack in resource utilization. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to affect economic activity in the United States and abroad. Meanwhile, shorter-horizon measures of inflation compensation ended the period modestly higher, but longer-term forward measures fell notably. Gross issuance of corporate bonds slowed from its brisk pace in May but remained solid, and gross issuance of leveraged loans was also robust. Some participants commented on the housing market and noted that ongoing rapid house price increases reflected both demand and supply factors. More recently, the detection and rapid spread of the Omicron variant prompted new international travel restrictions in many foreign economies. Some participants noted that businesses were offering higher wages, larger bonuses, or more flexible work arrangements to compete for workers. Some participants commented on the risk that financial conditions might tighten unduly in response to a rapid removal of policy accommodation. The Desk had onboarded four depository institutions as counterparties and noted that a number of additional banks were currently under review. The Omicron variant left only a mild and brief imprint on economic data, as households and firms appeared resilient to this wave of the virus. These participants also emphasized that price pressures remained elevated and that it was too early to be confident that inflation had peaked. For Treasury securities, the cap will initially be set at $30 billion per month and after three months will increase to $60 billion per month. In this environment, the exchange value of the dollar appreciated further, surpassing its March 2020 peak against advanced-economy currencies. In June, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 9.1 percent, while core CPI inflation was 5.9 percent over the same period. The private-sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, moved back down in October but remained high. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained at 4.7 percent in October. Stock market indexes rose, on balance, likely reflecting reduced concerns about the inflation outlook, and market volatility declined notably. In line with those developments, inflation compensation measures based on inflation swaps declined notably, especially for shorter maturities. Financial market conditions in the United States, as well as those abroad, suggested that investors were optimistic about the economic outlook. The staff forecast prepared for this meeting showed real GDP growth moderating somewhat from the average pace of the previous several quarters. Employment gains were widespread in the service sector, and the construction industry also added jobs, particularly in nonresidential building. Business purchases of light vehicles picked up in August after a weak performance in July, and sales of medium and heavy trucks remained brisk. Both imports and exports increased in the second quarter, but imports increased and exports decreased in July, widening the U.S. trade deficit. These developments led several programs to draw on backup lines, exercise options to extend the maturity of outstanding paper, or even default. Overall, growth in emerging Asia moderated somewhat in the third quarter from its double-digit pace in the second quarter, but remained strong. In addition, though the rise in food prices in October was slower than in August and September, it remained above that of core consumer prices. In the United States, headline consumer price inflation stepped up noticeably in November and December from the low rates posted in the summer. In addition, a consortium of 10 major banks announced the creation of a liquidity pool from which participants could draw collateralized loans. Over the intermeeting period, market participants marked down their expectations for the path of the federal funds rate for the next two years. Issuance of investment-grade corporate bonds was moderate in September and October, while there was little issuance of speculative-grade bonds. For most major industry groups, factory utilization rates declined relative to their levels in July and remained below their long-run averages. The Committee's statement noted that economic activity appeared to have slowed markedly, due importantly to a decline in consumer expenditures. One broad class of such tools was the use of FOMC communication with the public to provide more information regarding future policy intentions. As of January 26, the System's total assets and liabilities stood at just under $2 trillion, about $300 billion less than on December 17, 2008. Survey respondents also indicated that they had reduced the size of credit lines for a wide range of existing business and household customers. Against this backdrop, participants anticipated further employment cutbacks over coming months, though perhaps at a gradually diminishing rate. One member preferred to focus additional purchases on longer-term Treasury securities, whereas another member preferred to focus on agency MBS. Overall imports of consumer goods were also about unchanged, as a large decline in pharmaceuticals offset increases in a number of other goods. In contrast, the federal government issued debt at a rapid clip, and state and local government debt was estimated to have expanded moderately. There was general agreement that the Federal Reserve should assess over the next several months whether to maintain a TAF on a permanent basis. The Federal Reserve will also be working with its central bank counterparties to close its temporary liquidity swap arrangements by February 1. Downgrades to the credit ratings of Greece and Portugal weighed on investor sentiment, and global markets retraced some of their earlier gains. After changing little on net during the preceding year, interest rates for 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages moved lower in May and June. However, yields remained high even after these announcements and moved up subsequently, notwithstanding the ECB's purchases of government debt. The Bank of Canada tightened policy a step further during the period, raising its target for the overnight rate 25 basis points to 3/4 percent. But rising demand for equipment and software during the third quarter was also satisfied in part by a further rise in imports of capital goods. In addition, sales of new light motor vehicles climbed further in December after stepping up to a higher level during the preceding two months. Real nonfarm inventory investment appeared to have slowed substantially in the fourth quarter after a sizable increase in the previous quarter. However, consumer energy prices moved up sharply in December, and prices of most types of crude oil increased during December and into January. Strains in the municipal bond market eased as concerns about the budgetary problems of state and local governments seemed to diminish somewhat. The Committee expects these effects to be transitory, but it will pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations. In addition, survey measures of business conditions and sentiment in recent months were consistent with continued robust gains in E&S spending. Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index was moderately lower, on net, ending the intermeeting period at the low end of its recent range. These underlying factors included continued improvement in household balance sheets, easing credit conditions, and strengthening labor markets. The Committee expects these effects to be transitory, but it will pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations. Productivity in the nonfarm business sector rose only slightly over the past four-quarter period, so unit labor costs posted a modest increase. Consumer price inflation appeared to have moderated since earlier in the year, and measures of long-run inflation expectations remained stable. Dealers also indicated that their clients' willingness to bear risk generally had declined somewhat; that was particularly true of hedge funds. Earnings reports for nonfinancial firms generally came in somewhat better than investors expected and about in line with second-quarter levels. Participants' forecasts are described in more detail in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is attached as an addendum to these minutes. Others pointed out that the very modest increases in labor compensation of late suggested that underutilization of labor was still significant. Real business expenditures on equipment and software rose at a notably slower pace in the fourth quarter of last year than earlier in the year. Labor market conditions continued to improve, although unusually warm weather may have inflated payroll job figures somewhat earlier this year. Mortgage refinancing activity rose in April and May but remained subdued despite further declines in mortgage rates to historically low levels. However, another participant noted that recent appreciation of the dollar in foreign exchange markets would also contribute to reduced exports. Many FOMC participants judged that overall financial conditions had become somewhat less supportive of growth in demand for goods and services. In the farm sector, however, drought conditions likely reduced inventory accumulation last quarter and subtracted from overall economic growth. Broad U.S. equity price indexes edged up, on net, over the intermeeting period, while equity prices of large domestic banks decreased a little. Some participants stated that low interest rates appeared to be contributing to strong sales of autos or, more generally, of consumer durables. Automakers' schedules, however, indicated that the pace of motor vehicle assemblies in the coming months would be a bit below that in February. Measures of labor compensation indicated that gains in nominal wages remained relatively slow, only slightly above the rate of price inflation. Nonrevolving credit continued to increase at a solid pace because of growth in student and auto loans, while revolving credit was roughly flat. Emerging market mutual funds experienced sharp outflows in recent weeks, while EME stock prices declined and EME credit spreads widened on net. However, prospects for farm income were less positive as a result of the wet weather in the Midwest and expectations of lower prices for corn. During this general discussion of policy strategy and tactics, participants reviewed issues specific to the Committee's asset purchase program. The labor force participation rate also decreased, on balance, and the employment-to-population ratio in November was the same as in September. Similarly, institutional issuance of leveraged loans rose in October and November, and collateralized loan obligation issuance remained strong. A number of participants noted that current market expectations were reasonably well aligned with the Committee's recent policy communications. Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded by less in December than in the previous two months, perhaps partly because of unusually bad weather. Broad U.S. equity price indexes edged higher, on net, over the intermeeting period, and equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations increased. One of these members argued that the Committee should continue to provide quantitative thresholds for both the unemployment rate and inflation. The pace of activity in the housing sector remained soft, as real expenditures for residential investment decreased again in the first quarter. The payrolls of these governments expanded in April and May, and nominal state and local construction expenditures increased a little in April. Most participants supported reducing or ending re- investment sometime after the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate. The VIX, an index of option-implied volatility for one-month returns on the S&P 500 index, remained at low levels over the intermeeting period. The recovery in the housing sector remained slow despite low interest rates and some recent improvement in the availability of mortgage credit. The combination of these term and ON RRP test operations continued to provide a soft floor for money market rates over the intermeeting period. This change in the forward guidance does not indicate that the Committee has decided on the timing of the initial increase in the target range. The U.S. international trade deficit widened substantially in March but narrowed in April, leaving the deficit modestly wider than in February. Most of the increase in nominal yields was attributable to a rise in real yields, as measures of inflation compensation were relatively stable. On the one hand, a rebound in productivity growth in coming quarters might restrain hiring and slow the improvement in labor market conditions. The staff next summarized some of the recent steps the System had taken to prepare further for the process of normalization of monetary policy. The weakness in commodity prices and the appreciation of the dollar also continued to weigh on activity in the energy and agricultural sectors. Financing conditions for most businesses and households remained accommodative but tightened somewhat for businesses with lower credit quality. The staff's forecast for inflation in the near term was revised up a little, reflecting recent data, and it was unrevised over the medium term. It was noted that the System's reverse repurchase (RRP) agreement operations continued to provide a soft floor under short-term interest rates. The expected path of the federal funds rate implied by market quotes on interest rate derivatives rose moderately over the intermeeting period. However, demand for CRE loans reportedly strengthened, and CRE loans on banks' books continued to grow at a robust pace over the first quarter. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.7 percent in May, partly reflecting an unusually large number of unemployed persons exiting the labor force. The growth of commercial and industrial (C&I) lending on banks' books slowed in June, but expansion of such loans continued through early July. Several of these members observed that the recent pace of job gains remained well above that consistent with stable rates of labor utilization. The measure of longer-run inflation expectations for PCE prices from the Survey of Professional Forecasters was unchanged in the third quarter. Some participants noted the importance of clearly communicating to the public the conditions that would warrant an increase in the policy rate. Most private borrowing rates increased somewhat, but financing conditions for nonfinancial firms and households remained broadly accommodative. Participants generally agreed that they should continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. The pace of purchase originations was little changed in recent months despite higher mortgage rates, while refinance originations fell sharply. Net debt financing by nonfinancial businesses increased in the first quarter but remained noticeably below the pace of the same time last year. Over the 12 months ending in May, the consumer price index (CPI) rose a little less than 2 percent, while core CPI inflation was 1-3/4 percent. Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) remained accommodative, although the growth of CRE loans on banks' books slowed somewhat. Several participants observed that the banking system was well capitalized and had ample liquidity, reducing the risk of financial instability. After increasing in June, exports retraced a bit of this gain in July, with lower exports of consumer goods, automotive products, and services. Members saw near-term risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced, but they agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely. Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased a bit more than 1-1/2 percent over the 12 months ending in September. There was no discernible reaction in financial markets to the widely anticipated announcement of the FOMC's change to its balance sheet policy. The participation rate for prime-age (defined as ages 25 to 54) men edged up in December, while the rate for prime-age women declined slightly. Revolving credit expanded in November, while nonrevolving credit grew robustly, mainly driven by expansion in student and other consumer loans. Labor markets were generally strong, and contacts in a number of Districts reported shortages of workers in specific industries or occupations. Activity in the energy sector remained strong, and crude oil production was expected to continue to expand in response to rising global demand. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and core inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, had both moved close to 2 percent. Other business contacts facing labor shortages were responding by increasing training for less-qualified workers or by investing in automation. Accordingly, in their view, spells at the ELB could become more frequent and protracted than in the past, consistent with the staff's analysis. Foreign inflation had risen a bit recently, boosted by higher oil prices and, in the EMEs, higher food prices and recent currency depreciation. Participants discussed market commentary that suggested that the process of balance sheet normalization might be influencing financial markets. Participants also supported a proposal to remove from the statement the characterization of risks to the economic outlook as \"roughly balanced. The BEA estimated that the change in net exports was a drag of about 1/4 percentage point on the rate of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter. In reviewing global developments, the manager noted that market prices appeared to reflect perceptions of improved economic prospects in China. Incoming data on shipments and orders of new capital goods looked weak and recent readings from some manufacturing surveys had dropped sharply. Bank CRE loan growth slowed moderately since the second quarter, driven by slower growth in loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties. In light of these developments, most members agreed to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-3/4 to 2 percent at this meeting. The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through late November remained near historically low levels. They generally agreed that supervisory, regulatory, and macroprudential tools should be the primary means to address financial stability risks. A couple of these participants cited the potential for such a facility to reduce the banking system's demand for reserves over the longer term. Those Treasury and agency MBS purchases would be in addition to the recently expanded overnight and term repo operations conducted by the Desk. Participants generally commented that these additional measures would be helpful in supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. Real disposable personal income was about flat in the first quarter, so the personal saving rate moved up notably with the decline in spending. In contrast, the trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 2.0 percent in May. The increasing number of virus cases in many parts of the country had led to delays in some business reopenings and to some reclosures as well. There were also concerns that the anticipated increase in Treasury debt over the next few years could have implications for market functioning. Gross institutional leveraged loan issuance picked up slightly in July but remained below the levels observed during the same period last year. Participants noted that the COVID-19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The staff continued to observe that the uncertainty related to the future course of the pandemic and its consequences for the economy was high. Yields on 2-year nominal Treasury securities were little changed since the November FOMC meeting, while 10- and 30-year yields rose moderately. Participants noted that the COVID-19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Consistent with the optimism driving stock prices, spreads on corporate bond yields over comparable-maturity Treasury yields narrowed somewhat. In addition, members agreed that the ongoing public health crisis continued to weigh on the economy and risks to the economic outlook remained. Broad stock price indexes increased slightly over the intermeeting period, with stocks in cyclically sensitive sectors generally outperforming. The volume of credit rating upgrades for nonfinancial bonds and leveraged loans outpaced downgrades somewhat in the April-to-early-June period. The effective federal funds rate remained at 8 basis points throughout the period except on month-ends, while the SOFR averaged 5 basis points. Small business loan originations ticked down in October, likely reflecting weak loan demand as suggested by survey-based and market indicators. A few participants commented that both survey- and market-based measures of short-term inflation expectations were at historically high levels. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. The staff therefore anticipated that GDP growth would rebound in the second quarter and advance at a solid pace over the remainder of the year. In addition, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and COVID-related lockdowns in China were seen as likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. On balance, market participants were focused on the largely synchronous shift toward monetary policy tightening across most advanced economies. Additionally, most business contacts had continued to report persistent wage pressures as well as difficulties in hiring and retaining workers. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. Reflecting increases in both policy rates and corporate bond spreads, yields on corporate bonds rose significantly since the start of the year. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained generally strong, with low default rates for both corporate bonds and leveraged loans. In offshore dollar funding markets, the premium associated with borrowing dollars was modestly higher than at similar points in previous years. On a 12-month change basis, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 5.3 percent in 2022 and core inflation was expected to be 4.6 percent. The manager pro tem turned next to a discussion of operations and money markets and assessed that balance sheet runoff was proceeding smoothly. Nominal wage growth continued to be elevated and remained above the pace judged to be consistent with the FOMC's 2 percent inflation objective. On net, the one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 and the VIX decreased notably and was around the middle of its range since mid-2020. While delinquency rates on credit cards remained low relative to their historical range, those on auto loans surpassed their pre-pandemic peak. The manager pro tem turned first to a review of U.S. financial market developments. Narrowing yield differentials between the United States and some advanced foreign economies also contributed to the depreciation of the dollar. Meanwhile, issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities remained slow in November and December, amid high base interest rates and spreads. Mortgage applications continued to decline in February, and survey measures of homebuying attitudes also maintained their recent downward trend. Investors had largely anticipated both the Committee's interest rate decision at the January meeting and the text of the accompanying statement. Real consumer spending appeared to be on track to decelerate noticeably in the current quarter after posting robust growth in the first quarter. The slowdown was attributed in part to higher energy prices and also to a likely downshift in home price appreciation and higher interest rates. The growth of imports was heavily concentrated in oil, reflecting higher petroleum prices, and in non-oil industrial supplies and capital goods. A major exception was the motor vehicle sector, where the cutbacks in assemblies probably began to reduce the inventory overhang in that sector. Meeting participants reported that their business contacts were generally optimistic and perceived the economic outlook as relatively favorable. In addition, private payrolls posted only a small gain in August, and manufacturing production decreased after gains in the previous two months. Although growth remained robust in Canada, data late in the quarter, including retail sales, indicated a more significant weakening in activity. Output in high-tech industries moderated in the fourth quarter, largely because of a deceleration in production of computers and semiconductors. Real spending on equipment and software rose at a sluggish rate in the fourth quarter after having posted a solid increase in the third quarter. More generally, surveys of business conditions and sentiment deteriorated and suggested that capital spending would be reduced in the near term. In emerging Asia, the pace of real GDP growth picked up in the fourth quarter in China and South Korea, but it softened in most other countries. Neither the subsequent release of the minutes of the meeting nor the March 7 Federal Reserve announcements elicited significant market reaction. Strains in financial markets had increased, portending a possible further tightening in the availability of credit to households and businesses. Participants noted that the contraction in the housing sector had deepened and that considerable uncertainty surrounded the outlook for housing. The unemployment rate jumped from 5.0 percent in April to 5.5 percent in May and was now about a percentage point above its level of a year ago. Private nonfarm payroll employment fell in July at a pace only a bit less than the average monthly rate during the first six months of the year. During recent months, some cost pressures eased as the prices of crude oil and other commodities declined and non-oil import prices decelerated. The AMLF, CPFF, and MMIFF were intended to improve the liquidity in short-term debt markets and ease the strains in credit markets more broadly. Meeting participants noted that real consumer spending had been weakening through the summer, responding to lower employment and tighter credit. In Asia, output decelerated significantly, as the pace of real activity moderated in China and several other economies saw declines in real GDP. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury had previously announced their expectation that the program would be expanded to accept other types of ABS. Equity prices increased, money markets were functioning better, and corporate issuance of bonds and convertible securities was relatively brisk. Others were concerned that announcements of substantial additional purchases could add to perceptions that the federal debt was being monetized. Household spending has shown further signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. This caution, together with low utilization rates and substantial excess capacity, could hold back the rate of increase of new capital spending. Finally, staff noted that the Committee might want to address both the eventual size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and its composition. Outside of the transportation and high-tech sectors, business outlays on equipment and software appeared to change little in the fourth quarter. Production in high-tech industries increased solidly, and available indicators pointed toward further expansion in this sector in the near term. Capacity utilization in manufacturing in June stood well above its mid-2009 low, but it was still substantially short of its longer-run average. Sales of light motor vehicles continued to move up, on balance, with the level of sales in July slightly higher than the second-quarter average. The softer tone of incoming economic data suggested that the pace of the expansion would be slower over the near term than previously projected. One noted that survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations had remained positive in Japan throughout that country's bout of deflation. Headline consumer price inflation was subdued in recent months, despite a rise in energy prices, as core consumer price inflation trended lower. Book-value data for October and November suggested that the pace of inventory accumulation also was slowing outside of the motor vehicle sector. Issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities increased in the fourth quarter of 2010 but was still only a fraction of its pre-crisis level. Consumer spending was supported by a solid increase in real disposable income in January, reflecting in part the temporary cut in payroll taxes. As a result, the forecast for consumer price inflation over the medium run was little changed relative to that prepared for the January meeting. The staff next gave a presentation on strategies for normalizing the stance and conduct of monetary policy over time as the economy strengthens. Total consumer credit growth picked up in February, as a gain in nonrevolving credit more than offset a further contraction in revolving credit. The expansion of private nonfarm payroll employment in May was markedly below the average pace of job gains in the previous months of this year. The rate of growth in the emerging market economies stepped down from its rapid pace in the first quarter, although it remained generally solid. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate. Part of the downshift in global economic growth appeared to have been driven by temporary supply chain disruptions caused by Japan's earthquake. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate. China's central bank cut its reserve requirements by 50 basis points, and the central bank of Brazil lowered its policy rate by the same amount. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate. Mortgage delinquency rates, while improving gradually, remained elevated relative to pre-crisis norms, and house prices continued to move lower. Conditions in unsecured short-term dollar funding markets improved over the period, especially for financial institutions with European parents. Bank credit rose at a modest pace, on average, in January and February, mainly reflecting strong increases in securities holdings and C&I loans. Automakers' schedules indicated that the pace of motor vehicle assemblies in the third quarter would be about the same as in the second quarter. Participants discussed the effectiveness of purchases of Treasury securities relative to purchases of agency MBS in easing financial conditions. For example, yields on MBS dropped noticeably, leading to a decline in mortgage interest rates, and corporate bond yields generally moved lower. Measures of inflation compensation derived from nominal and inflation-protected Treasury securities rose slightly over the intermeeting period.혻 The Committee also retained its forward guidance about the federal funds rate, including the thresholds on the unemployment and inflation rates. One participant emphasized the role of recent asset purchases in keeping inflation from declining further below the Committee's longer-run goal. Several participants stated that such risks should not inhibit the Committee from pursuing its mandated objectives for inflation and employment. The Committee also retained its forward guidance about the federal funds rate, including the thresholds on the unemployment and inflation rates. The Committee also retained its forward guidance about the federal funds rate, including the thresholds on the unemployment and inflation rates. In particular, one pointed out that the furloughs scheduled for the second half of the year were likely to reduce household income and spending. Market-based measures of inflation expectations decreased over the intermeeting period but remained within their ranges over the past few years. Mortgage purchase applications declined modestly through July even as refinancing applications fell off sharply with the rise in mortgage rates. In August, nominal retail sales, excluding those at motor vehicle and parts outlets, edged up, while sales of light motor vehicles rose notably. Yields on corporate bonds, agency MBS, and Treasury inflation-protected securities rose about in line with those on nominal Treasury securities. The Desk's survey also indicated that the dealers had revised up their expectations of the total size of the Committee's asset purchase program. Mortgage refinancing applications were down dramatically compared with May, but purchase applications were only a bit below their earlier level. C. Maintain standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements with foreign banks in accordance with the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations. Conditions in the commercial real estate sector recovered further in the fourth quarter, with rising property prices and fewer distressed sales. The change in the Committee's guidance does not indicate any change in the Committee's policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements.\" In the agricultural sector, the planting season was under way, but there were concerns about the effects of drought on production in some areas. Third-quarter growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) remained healthy in the United Kingdom, and indicators for Canada also were positive. Contacts in several regions reported ready availability of credit, strong loan growth, or a steady increase in commercial construction activity. A few participants suggested that the statement should focus on the economic conditions that would likely accompany the decision to raise rates. C. Maintain standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements with foreign banks in accordance with the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations. In the January SLOOS, banks reported that standards continued to ease, on net, for CRE lending and noted stronger demand for all CRE loan types. A few of them noted that continued modest wage growth could prompt them to reduce their estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment. Agricultural production in several Districts appeared likely to benefit from wet weather, but weak farm income continued to weigh on the sector. Many expected that labor market underutilization would be largely eliminated around year-end if economic activity strengthened as they expected. In China, stock prices fell substantially, prompting a number of policy and regulatory actions by Chinese officials to support the stock market. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low, while survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained stable. Participants discussed the potential implications of recent economic and financial developments abroad for U.S. economic activity and inflation. Broad U.S. equity price indexes fell in the first few weeks after the September FOMC meeting but subsequently more than retraced those declines. Continued concerns about the outlook for global economic growth weighed on commodity and foreign equity prices early in the intermeeting period. Members indicated that they expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity would continue to expand at a moderate pace. Economic activity in Canada rebounded in the third quarter, boosted by rising exports and a smaller drag from declines in oil-sector investment. Equity indexes declined in many advanced and emerging market economies amid concerns about corporate earnings and falling oil and metals prices. Recently, some of the available surveys had reported softer longer-run inflation expectations, while others suggested still-stable expectations. C. Maintain standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements with foreign banks in accordance with the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations. However, leverage continued to increase in the nonfinancial business sector, particularly among energy-related and other relatively risky firms. Several saw that outlook as depending importantly on continued strengthening of the labor market or on an above-trend pace of economic activity. A range of recent labor market indicators, including strong job gains, points to some additional decline in underutilization of labor resources. In their comments on labor market conditions, participants cited strong payroll gains and a further tick down in the civilian unemployment rate. During their discussion of these developments, participants cited several factors that likely contributed to the easing in financial conditions. The rate of private-sector job openings declined in May, albeit from an elevated level, and the rates of hires and of quits were both unchanged. Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft decreased in May and June, and orders for these goods also declined on balance. The employment-to-population ratio for individuals aged 25 to 64 continued to be higher for whites than for African Americans and for Hispanics. They observed that monetary tightening in those episodes typically had been followed by recession and a large increase in the unemployment rate. Moreover, policymakers expected to benefit from accruing additional information before making judgments about a future implementation framework. Policymakers also underscored the importance of taking account of the possibility that neutral short-term interest rates could remain quite low. Indeed, unit sales of light motor vehicles rose sharply in September and moved higher in October, supported in part by sizable sales incentives. E. For reciprocal currency arrangements, standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements, and standing foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements: Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses, households, and state and local governments remained generally accommodative in recent months. Inflation in the AFEs continued to rise, largely because of the pass-through of earlier increases in crude oil prices into retail energy prices. Many participants saw the risks stemming from global economic and financial developments as having receded further over the intermeeting period. The Committee affirms that changing the target range for the federal funds rate is its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. Most AFE and EME equity indexes edged higher, supported by robust first-quarter earnings reports and generally positivee data releases overseas. The U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the July FOMC meeting was broadly similar to the previous forecast. Participants commented on a number of factors that would influence their ongoing assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate. One participant stressed that the risks both to the Committee's inflation objective and to financial stability would require careful monitoring. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices had declined this year and were running below 2 percent. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices had declined this year and were running below 2 percent. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices have declined this year and are running below 2 percent. Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased slightly more than 1-1/2 percent over the 12 months ending in October. The FOMC's decision at its December meeting to raise the target range for the federal funds rate was transmitted smoothly to money market rates. Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to move up this year and to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term. Almost all participants agreed that it remained appropriate to follow a gradual approach to raising the target range for the federal funds rate. The foreign exchange value of the dollar rose modestly, but this move retraced only a bit of the depreciation of the dollar since its 2016 peak. Treasury bill supply remained elevated and reportedly continued to contribute to upward pressure on overnight repurchase agreement (repo) rates. The revision in the expected policy path was less noticeable in the Desk's survey-based measures of the expected path of the federal funds rate. Under the baseline outlook, prepayments of principal on agency MBS would remain below the $20 billion redemption cap for the foreseeable future. AFE sovereign yields declined significantly, reflecting decreases in U.S. bond yields and weaker-than-expected euro-area and U.K. economic data. In many cases, nonfinancial firms' earnings reports suggested that tariffs were a salient concern in the changed outlook for corporate earnings. They observed that a regime that controlled the policy rate through active management of the supply of reserves likely would have disadvantages. In consumer credit markets, financing conditions tightened a bit but, on balance, remained generally supportive of growth in household spending. Credit card loan growth remained strong through December, though the pace slowed during 2018 amid tighter lending standards by commercial banks. FOMC communications following the May meeting had little net effect on yields, though they rose modestly following the Chair's press conference. Expectations for near-term domestic policy easing had occurred against the backdrop of a global shift toward more accommodative monetary policy. These pressures, in turn, seemed to stem partly from elevated dealer inventories of Treasury securities and dealers' associated financing needs. Industrial production increased modestly, on net, over July and August, but production remained notably lower than at the beginning of the year. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in August, reflecting a subdued pace of export growth and a moderate pace of import growth. The manager reported that the Desk is closely monitoring reserves and money market conditions and that it is prepared to adjust plans as needed. Total nonfarm payroll employment surged in November, boosted in part by the return of auto workers who had previously been on strike in October. However, new uncertainties had emerged regarding trade policy with Argentina, Brazil, and France, and political tensions in Hong Kong persisted. Other members thought that the reference to \"near\" 2 percent was intended to encompass modest deviations of inflation above and below 2 percent. This technical adjustment would reverse the small downward adjustment to administered rates made in September, when money markets were volatile. Conditions in domestic short-term funding markets, including in secured financing, were stable over the intermeeting period, even over year-end. Institutional leveraged loan issuance continued to be robust in December, reflecting solid refinancing activity and moderate new money issuance. Asset valuation pressures were characterized as fairly widespread across a number of markets, similar to the situation in much of 2017 and 2018. They remarked that the details of the Committee's plans would be adjusted as appropriate to support effective implementation of monetary policy. They further concurred that the unpredictable effects of the coronavirus outbreak were a source of major downside risks to the economic outlook. These indicators suggested considerable improvement in market functioning, and the Desk gradually scaled back the pace of purchases accordingly. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.5 percent over the 12 months ending in March, and the core CPI increased 2.1 percent over the same period. Financing conditions in residential mortgage markets were tight for low-rated borrowers and other borrowers who rely on nonconforming mortgages. At the end of the intermeeting period, both measures stood roughly halfway between their mid-March lows and typical levels seen in recent years. Speculative-grade corporate bond issuance picked up considerably toward the end of April from very low levels, though it slowed somewhat in May. Limited available sources of standard economic data, such as retail purchases and motor vehicle sales, also seemed in line with this impression. Technology stocks continued to outperform the broader market, whereas equity prices in the bank and energy sectors fell notably over the period. Municipal market financing conditions remained accommodative, although the credit quality of municipal debt continued to show signs of weakness. Labor market conditions continued to improve markedly in July and August, but employment was still below its level at the beginning of the year. Initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits continued to move down, on net, through early September, but the pace of declines had slowed. The amount of Federal Reserve repo outstanding remained at zero over the intermeeting period due to more attractive rates in the private market. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 and the VIX increased some, on net, after briefly rising sharply late in the intermeeting period. Even so, participants noted that economic activity and employment were currently well below levels consistent with achieving maximum employment. Alongside the rise in U.S. yields, broad U.S. equity price indexes increased moderately, with the largest gains in cyclically sensitive sectors. Against this backdrop, the effective federal funds rate softened modestly, while repurchase agreement (repo) rates declined to a greater extent. Amid stable market conditions, there was no take-up in the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility or the Commercial Paper Funding Facility. Participants discussed market- and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations and their implications for the inflation outlook. Despite recent improvements, lending standards for commercial and industrial (C&I) and consumer loans remained tighter than pre-pandemic levels. However, many EMEs continued to struggle to contain the virus amid a slow pace of vaccinations, particularly in South America and parts of Asia. Financing conditions for businesses and households remained accommodative, particularly for large firms and households with high credit ratings. Meanwhile, spreads on non-agency triple-A CMBS were little changed at accommodative levels, while non-agency triple-B spreads remained elevated. Expectations for the target federal funds rate based on survey responses and interest rate futures moved up slightly since the previous meeting. Advance estimates for September suggested that goods imports rose while goods exports fell, pointing to a further widening of the trade deficit. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose solidly, on average, in October and November, but the average gain was below that seen in recent quarters. As a result, the 12-month change in PCE prices was projected to move up further relative to October's pace and to end the year around 5 percent. An easing of supply constraints was expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation. Participants judged that labor markets continued to strengthen, with the unemployment rate falling rapidly and payrolls growing at a solid pace. They noted that the realization of such a development could make it harder for the Committee to achieve 2 percent inflation over the longer run. Motor vehicle assemblies reversed some of their November increase; in addition, manufacturing production outside of motor vehicles ticked lower. Market participants almost universally expected a 25 basis point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at the current meeting. Broad domestic equity price indexes declined on net, and the one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index and the VIX remained elevated. Inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. Paydowns of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) were projected to fall below the higher September cap of $35 billion beginning in September. Yields offered by MMMFs were well above those offered by banks, and the staff noted that this yield differential would attract inflows to MMMFs. The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: \"Recent indicators of spending and production have softened.\" Beyond that period, the market-implied path of the federal funds rate sloped downward, likely reflecting downside risks to the policy rate path. The median respondent to the Open Market Desk surveys expected the policy rate path to remain flat through 2023 after the peak rate was reached. In August, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 8.3 percent, while core CPI inflation was 6.3 percent over the same period. On a 12-month change basis, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 5.1 percent in 2022, and core inflation was expected to be 4.3 percent. These reports suggested that some firms continued to have solid pricing power, while in other cases cost pass-through had become more difficult. Several participants commented that continued rapid policy tightening increased the risk of instability or dislocations in the financial system. The number of home purchases and refinance mortgage rate locks edged lower at subdued levels despite recent declines in mortgage interest rates. Measures of expected default probabilities for corporate bonds and leveraged loans remained elevated relative to their historical distributions. In the January SLOOS, banks reported expecting a further deterioration in the quality of household loans in 2023, especially for consumer loans. Incoming data for the current quarter suggested that spending on transportation equipment reversed the run-up that occurred in the first quarter. Import growth was led by sharp rises in the value of imported oil and natural gas and increased imports of automotive products and capital goods. Incoming data across the emerging-market economies continued to point to moderating, but solid, growth in economic activity in the third quarter. These gains in spending were likely to be supported by past declines in energy prices and continued gains in payroll employment and labor income. Participants were concerned that inflation expectations could begin to drift upwards if core inflation remained elevated for a protracted period. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs shall be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and the Committee. Utilities output climbed for a second consecutive quarter, and mining output was boosted by increases in natural gas extraction and in crude oil. The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, but it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, but it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. In the euro area, growth was estimated to have remained subdued in the first quarter, with Germany and France faring better than Italy and Spain. In emerging market economies, economic growth slowed some in the fourth quarter and was estimated to have held about steady in the first quarter. At its April 29-30 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 2 percent. Tight conditions in the mortgage credit markets continued to restrain housing demand, particularly for borrowers seeking nonconforming mortgages. Corporate bond issuance slowed further, as did lending by banks to businesses and households, and issuance of leveraged loans remained very weak. For example, automotive parts suppliers in one District had reported plans for laying off workers, idling production, and closing several plants. The Committee's statement noted that economic activity expanded in the second quarter, partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports. Also, the Federal Reserve announced two forward TAF auctions for $150 billion each, to be conducted in November to provide funding over year-end. Survey results and anecdotal information also suggested that credit conditions had tightened significantly further for businesses and households. Several participants observed that it would be crucial for such policy actions to be unwound appropriately as the financial situation normalized. Subsequent purchases of agency debt by the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York led to a further reduction in agency spreads. Participants emphasized the importance of explicitly conditioning communication regarding future policy on the evolution of the economic outlook. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs shall be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and the Committee. Real spending on goods excluding motor vehicles was estimated to have fallen noticeably in December, more than reversing an increase in November. After improving during the early part of the intermeeting period, market sentiment toward financial firms appeared to worsen later in the period. Business inventories would come into line with even a low level of sales, and the pressure on production from inventory drawdowns would diminish. The decline in equipment and software (E&S) investment seemed to be moderating, although the incoming data did not point to an imminent recovery. The Desk is expected to purchase up to $200 billion in housing-related agency debt and up to $1.25 trillion of agency MBS by the end of the year. The July trade data provided additional evidence that the levels of both exports and imports probably reached their trough in the second quarter. Outlays for motor vehicles bounced back in October after a slump in September that followed the end of the \"cash-for-clunkers\" program in August. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs shall be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and the Committee. B. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.3. No market strains had appeared as a result of the imminent closing, on February 1, of most of the Federal Reserve's special liquidity facilities. All but the first of these tools would shrink the supply of reserve balances; the last two would also shrink the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. For the same reason, a few judged that it would be better to drain reserves concurrently with the eventual increase in the IOER and target rates. Participants saw the slower pace of inventory reductions as a welcome indication that, in general, firms no longer had large inventory overhangs. Available data for January indicated a further small liquidation of real stocks early this year in the manufacturing and wholesale trade sectors. The dollar value of commercial real estate sales remained very low in February, and the share of properties sold at a nominal loss inched higher. On a 12-month change basis, core PCE prices slowed over the year ending in March, with deceleration widespread across categories of expenditures. The economic forecast prepared by the staff for the April FOMC meeting was similar to that developed for the March meeting. The April fall in exports reflected declines in exports of consumer goods, primarily due to a drop in pharmaceuticals, and in agricultural goods. Consumer confidence fell back in July, with households expressing greater concern about their personal finances and the outlook for the recovery. In addition, survey results suggested that a sizable fraction of banks had eased loan terms, and a few had eased lending standards, on C&I loans. The rise in business outlays for equipment and software looked to have moderated recently following outsized gains in the first half of the year. Real inventory investment rose sharply in the third quarter, but book-value data for October suggested that the pace of accumulation was slowing. Exports of industrial supplies and agricultural goods registered the largest increases, although rising prices accounted for some of those gains. Banks in the euro-area periphery continued to rely heavily on funding from the ECB, and some signs of increased dollar funding pressures emerged. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs shall be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and the Committee. B. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.3. Industrial production posted solid gains, supported in part by U.S. exports that appeared to have been noticeably stronger in the fourth quarter. The available data on government spending indicated that real federal purchases fell in the first quarter, led by a reduction in defense outlays. One participant suggested that excess liquidity might be leading to speculation in commodity markets, possibly putting upward pressure on prices. The unemployment rate moved up in April and then rose further to 9.1 percent in May, while the labor force participation rate remained unchanged. Participants agreed to consider further how best to use their monetary policy and liquidity tools to deal with such shocks if they were to occur. Moreover, unemployment, particularly longer-term unemployment, remained high, and the number of involuntary part-time workers was still elevated. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs shall be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and the Committee. CDS spreads for states inched down further over the intermeeting period, and yields on long-term general obligation municipal bonds fell notably. The housing sector remained depressed, with very low levels of activity; there were, however, signs of improvement in some local housing markets. The information reviewed at the March 13 meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding moderately. Despite signs of improvement or stabilization in some local housing markets, most participants agreed that the housing sector remained depressed. Manufacturing production expanded, on net, in February and March, while the rate of manufacturing capacity utilization was essentially unchanged. The yield on nominal 10-year Treasury securities reached a historically low level immediately following the release of the May employment report. The Committee anticipates that inflation over the medium term will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee anticipates that inflation over the medium term will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate. In addition, business contacts noted that export demand was showing signs of weakness as a result of the slowdown in economic activity in Europe. A number of participants highlighted the uncertainty about the overall effects of additional purchases on financial markets and the real economy. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs shall be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and the Committee. Yields on speculative-grade corporate bonds decreased over the intermeeting period, and yields on investment-grade corporate bonds were up a bit. One participant suggested that the signaling effect of asset purchases may have been reduced by the adoption of threshold-based forward guidance. Overall U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, edged down in April, while the consumer price index (CPI) rose somewhat in May. A report on the favorable fiscal condition of one state was indicative of the improvement in the budget situation at state and local governments. Another participant raised the possibility that financial stability risks might arise from recent adverse developments in municipal bond markets. Business contacts generally reported continued moderate growth in sales, but remained cautious about expanding payrolls and capital expenditures. Participants broadly endorsed making the Committee's communications as simple, clear, and consistent as possible, and discussed ways of doing so. Moreover, recent information for key factors that support household spending was consistent with further solid gains in PCE in the coming months. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs shall be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and the Committee. Over the 12 months ending in December, nominal average hourly earnings for all employees increased slightly faster than consumer price inflation. In particular, the April SLOOS indicated a net easing of banks' credit standards for home-purchase loans to prime customers in the first quarter. Conditions in the labor market continued to improve over the intermeeting period and participants generally expected further gradual improvement. Household spending appeared to have risen moderately, on balance, in recent months, with sales of motor vehicles, in particular, rising strongly. Exports were little changed in June, but they expanded robustly in July, with particular strength in industrial supplies and automotive products. A few members, however, expressed reservations about continuing to characterize the extent of underutilization of labor resources as significant. In September, the unemployment rate declined to 5.9 percent, and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons decreased a little. As in the United States, participants in foreign financial markets became more concerned, on balance, about prospects for global economic growth. As expected, both participation and take-up in the operations continued to be sensitive to the offering rate and maximum individual award amount. In view of the uncertainties about the inflation outlook, the Committee agreed that it should continue to monitor inflation developments closely. The reduction in exports was largest for durable goods and industrial supplies, with exports to Canada and China accounting for most of the drop. Recent readings on the employment cost index, hourly compensation, and average hourly earnings of employees suggested some acceleration in wages. Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable; market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved lower. With energy and commodity prices expected to stabilize, members' projections of inflation incorporated a step-up in headline inflation next year. Some survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations edged down, while market-based measures of inflation compensation were still low. The available trade data suggested that declines in real net exports would likely continue to be a drag on real GDP growth in the fourth quarter. The cutbacks in drilling led to further reductions in capital spending and to layoffs; credit conditions for some firms continued to deteriorate. The effects of these financial developments, if they were to persist, may be roughly equivalent to those from further firming in monetary policy. Real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products appeared to be increasing only modestly in the first quarter. Several participants also noted the possibility that economic activity or labor market conditions could turn out to be stronger than anticipated. Meanwhile, nonfinancial firms continued to repurchase their shares at a brisk pace in the first quarter, and dividends stayed near record levels. Meeting participants commented on several other considerations that they saw as being relevant for evaluating possible implementation frameworks. In the United Kingdom, early indicators following the June 23 referendum on exit from the EU (\"Brexit\") pointed to a slowdown in economic growth. Some participants noted that recent signs of a moderate step-up in wage increases provided further evidence of improving labor market conditions. Capital flows to EMEs continued, and sovereign debt spreads in these economies and corporate bond spreads in both EMEs and AFEs narrowed further. Announcements by foreign central banks garnered investor attention and contributed to somewhat higher asset price volatility later in the period. Global yields moved higher and the euro strengthened following the meeting, as some market participants had expected an extension of the program. MMF reforms that became effective in mid-October had resulted in a substantial shift of assets out of prime funds and into government-only funds. Building permit issuance for new single-family homes--which tends to be a good indicator of the underlying trend in construction--also increased. In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), recent indicators were consistent with a more moderate pace of economic activity in the fourth quarter. In the euro area, investors were attentive to the constitutional referendum in Italy and the December meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB). The effective federal funds rate was 66 basis points--25 basis points higher than previously--every day following the change, except at year-end. In their discussion, participants considered how recent developments had affected their assessment of the stability of the U.S. financial system. Against this backdrop, they thought it appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at혻1/2 to혻3/4 percent at this meeting. The Committee's decision to keep the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at the January-February FOMC meeting was well anticipated. Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities were little changed, on net, since the February FOMC meeting. Market-based measures of inflation compensation had remained low; survey-based measures of inflation compensation were little changed on balance. Nonetheless, most participants continued to view the prospect of more expansionary fiscal policies as an upside risk to their economic forecasts. In the emerging market economies (EMEs), growth picked up in China and some Asian economies in the first quarter but slowed moderately in Mexico. On a 12-month basis, inflation has declined recently and, like the measure excluding food and energy prices, is running somewhat below 2 percent. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose solidly in July and August, with strong gains in private-sector jobs and declines in government employment. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appeared roughly balanced, but participants agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely. Although the unemployment rate was little changed from March to August, it remained below participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level. Financing conditions for businesses and households remained broadly supportive of continued growth in household spending and business investment. Nonetheless, members reiterated that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Growth of real final domestic purchases by households and businesses, generally a good indicator of the economy's underlying momentum, was solid. While borrowing costs moved up briefly in offshore dollar funding markets over year-end, conditions in money markets were reported to be orderly. Inflation on a 12-month basis was expected to move up this year and to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term. The projection for inflation over the medium term was revised up a bit, reflecting the slightly tighter resource utilization in the new forecast. Nonetheless, they again stated that the actual path for the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose less in March than in the previous two months, but the increase for the first quarter as a whole was solid. The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons was little changed at a rate close to that prevailing before the previous recession. The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons was little changed at a level close to that from just before the previous recession. Starts for new single-family homes were unchanged in April from their first-quarter average, but starts of multifamily units declined noticeably. In addition, all participants pointed to ongoing trade disagreements and proposed trade measures as an important source of uncertainty and risks. Such concerns led the Shanghai Composite index to drop as much as 8 percent at one point over the intermeeting period before recovering somewhat. A number of participants observed that the stimulative effects of the changes in fiscal policy would likely diminish over the next several years. These approaches could allow markets and banks more time to adjust to lower reserve levels while maintaining effective control of interest rates. Among EMEs, growth in Mexico and Brazil bounced back from transitory second-quarter weakness, more than offsetting a slowdown in China and India. Household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year. Participants observed that both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent on a 12-month basis. Household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year. Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year. Imports decreased in November before partially recovering in December, with imports of consumer goods and industrial supplies driving this swing. As a result, core PCE price inflation was expected to move up in the near term but nevertheless to run just below 2 percent over the medium term. Although growth of household spending appears to have picked up from earlier in the year, indicators of business fixed investment have been soft. Issuance of institutional leveraged loans increased notably in May but in June, it returned to the more moderate pace observed earlier this year. A couple of participants judged that the monitoring of financial stability vulnerabilities should also encompass risks related to climate change. The expected path of the federal funds rate implied by the medians of survey respondents' modal forecasts remained essentially flat through 2020. While inflation is inherently variable, the Committee then could emphasize its intention for inflation to be centered on the 2 percent objective. Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak and a manufacturing hub, was put under quarantine, and factories across the country were shut down. Importantly, the future performance of the economy would depend on the evolution of the virus outbreak and the measures undertaken to contain it. By the end of the intermeeting period, policy rates in most major advanced foreign economies (AFEs) were at or near their effective lower bounds. Several participants remarked that a program of ongoing Treasury securities purchases could be used in the future to keep longer-term yields low. In contrast, the trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.9 percent in April. Participants agreed that the data for the second quarter would likely show the largest decline in economic activity in post-World War II history. Several participants relayed examples of some operational difficulties their business contacts were reportedly facing in the current environment. Participants agreed that this discussion would be helpful for future assessments of the appropriate structure of the Committee's asset purchases. The coronavirus pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to affect economic activity in the United States and abroad. That said, a few participants stated that it would be important to stay vigilant to ensure that the banking system remained strong and resilient. Participants noted that the COVID-19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Most participants judged that the Committee's standard of \"substantial further progress\" toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met. On net, the market-implied path of the policy rate was little changed for horizons up to late 2023, while it shifted lower beyond those horizons. For the intermeeting period as a whole, however, the VIX was little changed, on net, and remained somewhat above its average pre-pandemic levels. In addition, according to the July SLOOS, bank lending standards for jumbo loans eased over the second quarter to near their pre-pandemic levels. In the financial sector, the staff noted that banks were strongly capitalized, with high levels of stable funding and high-quality liquid assets. Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy had contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors. The potential for a less accommodative policy stance over the next few years contributed to a notable rise in two- and five-year Treasury yields. On the outlook for policy rates, several central banks had either already increased their policy rates or were expected to do so later this year. Although real state and local purchases appeared to be rising, federal defense purchases appeared to be contracting further in the first quarter. Several participants indicated that some of their contacts reported that the pace of consumer spending, though strong, was beginning to moderate. Several participants noted that financial market liquidity had been low in some areas but that market functioning had, nonetheless, been orderly. U.S. financial conditions tightened over the period, largely reflecting an upward revision in investors' outlook for the path of the policy rate. Several commented that they considered it likely that the transition would occur primarily through reduced job vacancies and slower job creation. In response, fiscal authorities in Europe and Japan announced packages intended to ease the burden of high inflation on consumers and businesses. Even so, participants remarked that the improvements in supply chains had not been uniform and supply shortages remained for some types of goods. A couple of participants noted that high costs for inputs like diesel, feed, and fertilizer were creating challenges for the agricultural sector. They also agreed that the war and related events were contributing to upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. Credit availability for households with lower credit scores was considerably tighter, though comparable to levels prevailing before the pandemic. A number of participants commented that supply bottlenecks continued to ease, although supply chain issues remained a challenge in some sectors. However, monetary policy accommodation, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, was providing ongoing support to economic activity. With few exceptions, however, new orders appeared to be quite strong, and order backlogs increased for several goods in the transportation sector. Warm weather boosted housing construction in January and February, although sales of new homes dropped back and house prices decelerated slightly. The recent behavior of core consumer prices seemed to indicate that any pass-through of higher energy and other commodity prices had been limited. Thus, consumer prices, after increasing at a faster rate in the first half of the year, were expected to decelerate later this year and next year. Utilities output also grew strongly in April but retreated in May as temperatures returned to normal after having been unseasonably warm in April. At its May meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to raise its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 5 percent. Nonfarm payrolls rose modestly in September after a larger increase in August, with some of the variation apparently a result of seasonal factors. Moreover, lower housing wealth, slower gains in employment and income, and reduced confidence seemed likely to restrain consumer spending in 2008. In longer-term corporate markets, both investment- and speculative-grade credit spreads widened considerably; issuance slowed but remained strong. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement. The Committee then turned to a discussion of selected longer-term regulatory and structural issues raised by recent financial market developments. The recent softening in residential housing demand was consistent with reports of tighter credit conditions for both prime and nonprime borrowers. At its March 18 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered its target for the federal funds rate 75 basis points, to 2-1/4 percent. Indicators of business sentiment were low, and reports from business contacts suggested that firms were scaling back their capital spending plans. In the overnight federal funds market, financial institutions became more selective about the counterparties with whom they were willing to trade. The comparative strength of existing home sales appeared to be attributable partly to increases in foreclosure-related and other distressed sales. At its October 28-29 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 1 percent. Credit conditions continued to tighten for both households and businesses, and ongoing declines in equity prices further reduced household wealth. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.2. There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the period since the Committee's January 27-28 meeting. The available data suggested that real consumer spending rose moderately in the first quarter after having fallen in the second half of last year. An unusually large proportion of employed persons indicated that they were engaged in part-time work because they could not obtain full-time jobs. Moreover, participants viewed the availability of the liquidity facilities as a factor that had contributed to the reduction in financial strains. The production of motor vehicles and parts dropped sharply in May, principally because of extended plant shutdowns at General Motors and Chrysler. Real outlays on services were reported to have picked up some in April from the average monthly gain seen over the first three months of the year. Still, in light of the signs that economic activity was stabilizing, most participants saw less downside risk to their expectations for inflation. Consumer spending dropped only a little further in the first half of this year, on balance, after falling sharply in the second half of last year. The increase largely reflected a sizable increase in gasoline prices, which appeared to have caught up with earlier increases in crude oil prices. Several participants noted the recent rebound in equity prices and thus household wealth as a factor that was likely to support consumer spending. International trade in emerging market economies picked up, supported by Chinese demand, while demand from advanced economies still appeared weak. TAF auctions continued to be undersubscribed even as the Federal Reserve progressively reduced the total amount of funding available from the TAF. The federal government continued to issue debt at a brisk pace, and gross issuance of state and local government debt remained strong in November. Business contacts again emphasized they would be cautious in adding to payrolls and capital spending, even as demand for their products increases. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.2. Consumer spending was well maintained in the fourth quarter, and business expenditures on equipment and software appeared to expand substantially. Recent data suggested that the pace of inventory liquidation diminished considerably last quarter, providing a sizable boost to economic activity. The Committee will continue to evaluate its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. In Latin America, Mexican activity was buoyed by rising manufacturing and exports to the United States, while Brazil's economy again grew briskly. Headline consumer price inflation picked up around the world over the past two months, principally reflecting increases in food and energy prices. Outlays for new power plants and for manufacturing facilities firmed, and investment in drilling and mining structures continued to rise strongly. Gross equity issuance fell a bit, on net, in April and May, likely due in part to recent declines in equity prices and elevated market volatility. Participants commented that household spending continued to advance, with notable increases in auto sales and expenditures on other durable goods. Reportedly, employers were still cautious about adding to payrolls, given uncertainties about the outlook for the economy and government policies. Commercial banks' core loans--the sum of commercial and industrial (C&I), real estate, and consumer loans--continued to contract in June and July. A number of participants noted that the current sluggish pace of employment growth was insufficient to reduce unemployment at a satisfactory pace. Private-sector wage increases, as measured by both average hourly earnings of all employees and the employment cost index (ECI), remained subdued. Bank credit edged up in September and October, as brisk growth in banks' holdings of securities more than offset a further decline in total loans. In October, core PCE prices were unchanged for a second month, as goods prices declined and prices of non-energy services posted a small increase. China's Shanghai Composite Index fell in the wake of Chinese policy actions, while other emerging market stock indexes were mixed over the period. It was noted that the backup in rates may have been amplified by year-end positioning, as well as by some reported mortgage-related hedging flows. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement. Outstanding residential mortgage debt declined further in the third quarter of 2010, reflecting weak housing activity and tight lending standards. Over the intermeeting period, yields on nominal Treasury securities changed little, on net, amid swings in investors' assessments of global risks. Growth in total consumer credit picked up in April, as the gain in nonrevolving credit more than offset a further contraction in revolving credit. Initial claims for unemployment insurance stepped down some in recent weeks but remained elevated, and indicators of hiring showed no improvement. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement. Higher prices for energy and food put upward pressure on headline inflation in foreign economies, but measures of core inflation remained subdued. Prices in the secondary market for syndicated leveraged loans moved up further, supported by continued strong demand from institutional investors. Several participants indicated that uncertainty about the trajectory of future fiscal policy could lead businesses to defer hiring and investment. The May Survey of Terms of Business Lending indicated that lending conditions again eased slightly, although perhaps less so for small businesses. Consistent with Committee practice, the Chairman, if feasible, will consult with the Committee before making any instruction under this paragraph. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.2. Private nonfarm employment expanded in December at about the same rate as in the fourth quarter as a whole, while government employment decreased. Automakers' schedules indicated that the pace of motor vehicle assemblies in the first quarter would be roughly the same as in the fourth quarter. Yields on residential mortgage-backed securities (MBS) rose by more, leaving the spread between the primary mortgage rate and MBS yields narrower. One participant also indicated a preference for lowering the threshold for the unemployment rate as a means of providing additional accommodation. Real business expenditures on equipment and software appeared to slow somewhat early this year after rising at a brisk rate in the fourth quarter. Total combined starts of new single-family homes and multifamily units increased in March to a level well above that at the beginning of the year. A number thought that the postmeeting statement might be the appropriate vehicle for providing additional information on the Committee's thinking. Growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products appeared to be subdued going into the third quarter. Committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity was expanding at a moderate pace. Consumer price inflation continued to run below the Committee's objective, although measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable. Consistent with Committee practice, the Chairman, if feasible, will consult with the Committee before making any instruction under this paragraph. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced more quickly in recent months, while the recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat. Institutional issuance of leveraged loans continued at a brisk pace amid reports of an ongoing gradual easing of credit terms and deal structures. Inflation firmed in recent months, and most participants anticipated that it would continue to move up toward the Committee's 2 percent objective. Over the 12 months ending in September, both the consumer price index (CPI) and the CPI excluding food and energy prices rose about 1-3/4 percent. Despite some volatility related to quarter-end, conditions in unsecured funding markets were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period. Market participants became a bit more optimistic about U.S. economic prospects while also responding to economic and policy developments abroad. The Selected Bank may:i. Reject bids that, as determined in its sole discretion, could facilitate a bidder's ability to control a single issue;ii. In the first of these proposals, the Desk would conduct a series of preannounced term RRP operations that would span the end of the first quarter. In contrast, a couple of participants suggested that nominal wage growth provides little information about the future behavior of price inflation. Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index over the next month increased, on balance, but remained near the lower end of its historical range. To some, the continued subdued trend in wages was evidence of an absence of upward pressure on inflation from current levels of labor utilization. Across the credit spectrum, spreads were generally near their highest levels in several years and ended the period above their historical medians. Market-based measures of inflation compensation moved slightly lower; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained stable. The Selected Bank may:i. Reject bids that, as determined in its sole discretion, could facilitate a bidder's ability to control a single issue;ii. Recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending generally pointed toward solid growth in real PCE over the first half of the year. Broad equity market indexes increased, on balance, over the intermeeting period and continued to exhibit a high correlation with crude oil prices. It was also noted that businesses might satisfy increases in labor demand in part by converting involuntary part-time jobs to full-time positions. Finally, the manager briefed the Committee on various efforts, including small-value tests of System facilities, to enhance operational readiness. Over the first two months of the second quarter, both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio moved down on net. Amid still-low yields, bond issuance by investment-grade corporations rose to a robust pace in May, and speculative-grade issuance also picked up. Nevertheless, a few participants continued to caution about the risks to the inflation outlook from overshooting the natural rate of unemployment. In addition, consumer sentiment as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers remained relatively upbeat through early September. Rates on short-term municipal securities and net yields on tax-exempt MMFs also increased sharply, primarily because of outflows from these funds. At its early August meeting, the Bank of England announced a rate cut, a resumption of its asset purchase program, and a new bank funding program. Measures of the liquidity of institutional prime funds, which had increased substantially ahead of the compliance deadline, subsequently declined. The Selected Bank may:i. Reject bids that, as determined in its sole discretion, could facilitate a bidder's ability to control a single issue;ii. The change in real inventory investment was estimated to have made an appreciable positive contribution to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; most survey-based measures of inflation compensation were little changed on balance. Over the past year or so, the jobless rate for African Americans moved lower, while the rates for Hispanics and for whites moved roughly sideways. The overall labor force participation rate declined somewhat, and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons decreased a little. Bond yields in advanced economies increased moderately, in part reflecting evolving market perceptions of prospects for foreign monetary policies. The euro appreciated modestly against the U.S. dollar, in part because of strong economic data for the euro area early in the intermeeting period. The Selected Bank may:i. Reject bids that, as determined in its sole discretion, could facilitate a bidder's ability to control a single issue;ii. Spreads on commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) were little changed over the intermeeting period and remained near their post-crisis lows. Participants agreed that it would be appropriate for the Committee to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting. The Selected Bank may:i. Reject bids that, as determined in its sole discretion, could facilitate a bidder's ability to control a single issue;ii. The Committee is prepared to adjust any of the details for completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments. Spreads on nonfinancial corporate bonds were volatile but narrowed a bit, on net, and stayed at levels well above those that prevailed a year ago. A couple of participants noted that the rise in credit spreads over recent months, if it were to persist, could restrain future economic activity. Under the proposed approach, the Desk would plan open market operations to maintain the daily level of reserves above the minimum operating level. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.4 percent over the 12 months ending in February, a significantly faster pace than a year earlier. But the staff judged that the first-quarter slowdown would be transitory and that real GDP growth would bounce back solidly in the second quarter. The information available for the June 18-19 meeting indicated that labor market conditions remained strong. Foreign inflation remained subdued but rose a bit from lows earlier in the year, in part reflecting higher retail energy prices in many economies. However, some better-than-expected economic data releases and a slight improvement in the outlook regarding trade partially offset these declines. Financing conditions for businesses and households were little changed over the intermeeting period and remained generally supportive of spending. Over the intermeeting period, market-based expectations for the federal funds rate for the end of this year and beyond moved down slightly on net. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to show signs of stabilization in June following some deterioration earlier in the year. Interest rates on auto loans fell, on net, since the beginning of the year, and interest rates on credit card accounts leveled off through August. Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, and market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low. The Selected Bank may:i. Reject bids that, as determined in its sole discretion, could facilitate a bidder's ability to control a single issue;ii. The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, Hispanics, and whites were below their levels at the end of the previous economic expansion. Responses to the January 2020 SLOOS suggested that lending standards and demand for most CRE loan categories were unchanged in the fourth quarter. Market-based measures of inflation compensation had declined, and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed. Members judged that the effects of the coronavirus would weigh on economic activity in the near term and would pose risks to the economic outlook. Moreover, the consumer sentiment measures from both the Michigan and the Conference Board surveys deteriorated substantially over March and April. Yields on nominal Treasury securities declined across the maturity spectrum, with the 10- and 30-year yields ending the period near all-time lows. The market for agency MBS also experienced substantial stresses in mid-March, and agency MBS spreads to Treasury yields widened and were volatile. Under the baseline assumptions, economic conditions were projected to continue to improve, and inflation to pick back up, over the next two years. Participants expressed concerns that a large number of small businesses may not be able to endure a shock that had long-lasting financial effects. Under the baseline assumptions, economic conditions were projected to continue to improve, and inflation to pick back up, over the next two years. Participants noted that the coronavirus outbreak was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. By comparison, the trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.8 percent in July. The latest readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations moved up a bit but remained within their ranges in recent years. Members generally expected that it would be appropriate to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes were achieved. Members considered the staff proposal to eliminate the requirement in the directive to increase the holdings of agency CMBS in the SOMA portfolio. In November, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 1.2 percent, while core CPI inflation was 1.6 percent over the same period. The Selected Bank may:i. Reject bids that, as determined in its sole discretion, could facilitate a bidder's ability to control a single issue;ii. Measures of inflation compensation increased over the period, with the five-year, five-year-forward measure rising to a level of around 2 percent. The unemployment rate for African Americans declined and the Hispanic unemployment rate rose; both rates remained well above the national average. In December, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 1.4 percent, while core CPI inflation was 1.6 percent over the same period. Although home sales turned down in November, the decline appeared to reflect limited availability of homes for sale rather than weakening demand. Model- and survey-based estimates suggested that a significant portion of the increase in yields was associated with an increase in term premiums. In February, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 1.7 percent, while core CPI inflation was 1.3 percent over the same period. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 and the VIX fluctuated over a wide range during the intermeeting period but moved lower on balance. In particular, various participants noted that changes in the path of policy should be based primarily on observed outcomes rather than forecasts. Issuance of municipal bonds was strong in March, and indicators of the credit quality of municipal debt were little changed in February and March. Banks also reported that standards on credit cards eased over the first quarter of 2021 but were generally still tighter than before the pandemic. The U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the April FOMC meeting was slightly stronger than the March forecast. Exports and imports of services remained depressed relative to pre-pandemic levels, as international travel increased only slightly from February. Consumer credit jumped in May and remained strong in June, reflecting a rebound in credit card balances and continued robust growth in auto loans. Participants discussed the progress toward the Committee's goals since December 2020, when the Committee adopted its guidance for asset purchases. Initial claims for regular state unemployment insurance moved lower through late October and were approaching the levels seen before the pandemic. Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors. Financial markets responded to significant new information about the economy and monetary policy, as well as the emergence of the Omicron variant. They agreed that their discussion at this meeting would be helpful background for the Committee's future decisions regarding policy normalization. In November, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 6.8 percent, while core CPI inflation was 4.9 percent over the same period. The credit quality of municipal debt continued to be stable, as the number of bond upgrades outpaced downgrades, and defaults were relatively low. Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy had continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. Many business contacts continued to experience difficulty hiring workers across all skill levels, noting the lack of qualified candidates as well. The Selected Bank may:i. Reject bids that, as determined in its sole discretion, could facilitate a bidder's ability to control a single issue;ii. In December, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 7.0 percent, while core CPI inflation was 5.5 percent over the same period. Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy had continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. A few participants also reported contacts having been forced to reduce operating hours or close businesses temporarily because of labor shortages. Some participants saw emerging risks to financial stability associated with the rapid growth in crypto-assets and decentralized finance platforms. Participants also generally agreed that the caps could be phased in over a period of three months or modestly longer if market conditions warrant. In February, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 7.9 percent, while core CPI inflation was 6.4 percent over the same period. Trading volumes generally remained within normal ranges in most markets and increased above normal levels in Treasury markets later in the period. Market- and survey-based measures of U.S. inflation expectations continued to project a significant deceleration in inflation in the coming years. Borrowing costs for residential mortgage loans increased substantially, with the 30-year mortgage offer rates reaching levels not seen since 2010. In domestic credit markets, financing conditions for most businesses and households remained generally accommodative over the intermeeting period. That said, auto loans outstanding continued to grow at a robust pace in April and May but credit card balances moderated somewhat in May and June. Usage of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility remained fairly steady other than during the period surrounding quarter-end. Several participants summarized reports provided by business contacts about their firms' ability to pass on higher input costs to their customers. The manager pro tem turned first to a discussion of developments in financial markets. In addition, survey information suggested that banks expected to move deposit rates modestly higher relative to the target range in coming months. Credit availability for households with lower credit scores was considerably tighter at levels comparable with what prevailed before the pandemic. In their discussion of current economic conditions, participants noted that recent indicators pointed to modest growth of spending and production. A couple of participants observed that changes in wages tend to lag changes in prices, which can complicate the assessment of inflation pressures. A fall in net exports held back expansion in Japan and Canada, while strong domestic demand boosted growth in the United Kingdom and the euro area. Computer production continued to increase at a tepid rate, while output of communications equipment turned up noticeably after a decline in August. M2 grew slowly in the third quarter, exhibiting the lagged effects of earlier increases in opportunity costs and the slow rise in nominal spending. Most participants expected core inflation to moderate gradually, but they were quite uncertain as to the likely pace and extent of that moderation. Goods exports were boosted by a jump in exports of agricultural products and of gold, which more than offset a decline in exports of other goods.   Debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors was estimated to have expanded slightly more quickly in the third quarter than in the previous quarter.   Some participants said that higher input costs and rising prices of imports were leading more firms to seek price increases for goods and services. Real nonfarm inventory investment excluding motor vehicles appeared to have stepped up from its average rate over the first three quarters of 2007. The rise in small time deposits moderated but remained elevated, as several thrift institutions offered attractive deposit rates to secure funding. In addition, members saw continuing downside risks to this outlook, particularly reflecting possible further deterioration in financial conditions. In Asia, output decelerated significantly in the second quarter, as growth moderated in China and weakened more sharply in several other economies. Yields on longer-term inflation-indexed Treasury securities, which are relatively illiquid, rose more sharply than did those on nominal securities. And some also noted that the Committee had limited room to lower its federal funds rate target further and should therefore consider moving slowly. Meeting participants noted that economic conditions had deteriorated substantially in recent months in both advanced and emerging market economies. There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the period since the Committee's December 15-16 meeting. They also agreed to continue using liquidity and asset-purchase programs to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy. As of March 12, the System's total assets and liabilities were about $2 trillion, close to the level of that just before the January 27-28 meeting. Some indicators, including share prices and CDS spreads of financial institutions, suggested a worsening of financial market strains since January. The staff also reviewed the experience to date with the Federal Reserve's purchases of Treasury securities, agency debt securities, and agency MBS. However, substantial resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures, and the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time. However, substantial resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures, and the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time. The sharp cuts in production this year reduced inventory stocks significantly, though they remained elevated relative to the recent level of sales. In the residential real estate sector, home sales and construction had increased from very low levels, and house prices appeared to be stabilizing. Economic activity in emerging market economies continued to expand in the fourth quarter, although at a pace slower than that of the third quarter. Capacity utilization in manufacturing rose further, to a level noticeably above its trough in June, but remained well below its longer-run average. As a result, the net amount of outstanding TALF credit had leveled out and would likely decline going forward as a result of continuing repayments. Oil and other industrial supplies accounted for much of the increase in imports over the two months, while purchases of consumer products declined. The interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages fell further during July, reaching a record low for the 39-year history of the series. Imports of consumer goods fell substantially in July, while imports of industrial supplies, capital goods, and automotive products also moved down. The greater volatility in bank stocks reportedly reflected, in part, the effects of domestic and international financial regulatory reform efforts. Surveys taken in September and October indicated that consumers were slightly more pessimistic about the economic outlook than earlier in the year. More recent indicators for the EMEs, including purchasing managers indexes (PMIs), pointed to a rebound in economic activity in the fourth quarter. Despite further increases in commodity prices, measures of underlying inflation remained subdued and longer-run inflation expectations were stable. Benchmark 10-year sovereign yields moved higher in the core euro-area economies and the United Kingdom but were little changed in Japan and Canada. On net over the intermeeting period, stock prices were down in most of the advanced economies, with Japan's index having fallen most significantly. Real nonfarm inventory investment appeared to have moved up to a moderate pace in the first quarter after slowing sharply in the preceding quarter. At the state and local level, real government purchases seemed set to decline further as payrolls were reduced and construction spending decreased. Available measures of labor compensation indicated that wage increases continued to be restrained by the large margin of slack in the labor market. Yields on Italian and Spanish debt, which declined following reported ECB purchases in early August, drifted higher during the intermeeting period. They expected this program to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and to help make broader financial conditions more accommodative. Foreign financial markets remained volatile over the intermeeting period, and funding pressures for many European financial institutions continued. Consequently, the staff's outlook for economic activity over the medium term was similar to the projection prepared for the September FOMC meeting. Following the six major central banks' currency swap announcement, some measures of short-term funding costs moderated, but they remained elevated. Several European banks announced large declines in third-quarter profits, in part reflecting write-downs of their holdings of Greek sovereign debt. Committee participants discussed possible changes to the forward guidance that has been included in the Committee's recent post-meeting statements. Indicators of inflation compensation over the next five years edged up, while changes in measures of longer-term inflation compensation were mixed. Reports from business contacts indicated that activity in the manufacturing, energy, and agriculture sectors continued to advance in recent months. Over subsequent weeks, however, yields drifted lower in response to disappointing economic news and increased concerns about the strains in Europe. Reports from business contacts indicated that activity in the manufacturing, energy, and agriculture sectors continued to advance in recent months. A few participants expressed concern that slow growth in employment and low levels of consumer confidence would further restrain consumer spending. However, new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft decreased last quarter, and the backlog of unfilled orders decelerated sharply. Their spreads relative to comparable-maturity Treasury securities narrowed but were still above their average levels prior to the financial crisis. Imports also declined in July, reflecting lower imports of capital goods and petroleum products and somewhat higher imports of automotive products. Other participants, by contrast, saw inflation risks as tilted to the downside, given their expectations for sizable and persistent resource slack. In contrast, consumer sentiment rose in September and early October, and continued modest increases in house prices added to households' net worth. The Committee also agreed to maintain its policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency MBS into agency MBS. Hurricane Sandy was expected to weigh on economic growth in the current quarter, but rebuilding could provide some temporary impetus early in 2013. It was also noted that continued deleveraging by households was improving their financial positions, which would likely support increased spending. Both domestic and foreign asset markets were volatile at times during the intermeeting period, reacting to policy communications and data releases. Five- and 10-year yields on both nominal and inflation-protected Treasury securities declined 30 basis points or more over the intermeeting period. Automobile asset-backed securities (ABS) issuance accelerated in November, and issuance of paper backed by subprime automobile loans stayed strong. Consumer spending appeared to be strengthening, with solid gains in retail sales in recent months and a rebound in motor vehicle sales in November. Adjustments to the bid limit would be made in gradual steps, and the Committee would be consulted before the exercise would move to full allotment. Indicators of foreign economic activity suggested continued expansion in the first quarter but at a rate somewhat below that in the fourth quarter. Real GDP growth remained strong in the United Kingdom, and data for both Canada and the euro area showed improvement relative to the first quarter. According to the July SLOOS, banks continued to ease their standards and report stronger demand for CRE loans during the second quarter on balance. The reports from their business contacts provided support for participants' expectation of stronger economic growth in the second half of the year. Moreover, new orders for these capital goods continued to be above the level of shipments, pointing to increases in shipments in subsequent months. Imports rose in December, with an increased volume of petroleum imports, but declined in January, driven by lower prices and volumes for petroleum. Commercial and industrial loans on banks' books continued to expand strongly, reportedly in part to fund increased merger and acquisition activity. Measures of residential mortgage lending conditions were generally little changed over the intermeeting period, and lending volumes remained light. Most participants judged that the conditions for policy firming had not yet been achieved; a number of them cautioned against a premature decision. Many members thought that labor market underutilization would be largely eliminated in the near term if economic activity evolved as they expected. Available indicators of drilling activity, such as counts of rigs in operation, suggested spending would decline less rapidly in the third quarter. On net, the level of GDP was anticipated to rise above its potential next year, and that gap was projected to widen gradually over the medium term. Consistent with the downside risk to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as skewed to the upside. Consistent with the downside risk to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as skewed to the upside. Manufacturing output decreased, partly reflecting the effects on export demand of earlier appreciation of the foreign exchange value of the dollar. Information on extraction and drilling activity for crude oil and natural gas in early April was consistent with further declines in mining output. Credit conditions in municipal bond markets continued to be stable even as the situation facing Puerto Rico and its creditors deteriorated further. Consistent with the downside risk to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as skewed to the upside. The employment report for May showed considerably weaker growth in payrolls than had been expected, and gains in previous months were revised down. Almost all participants judged that the surprisingly weak May employment report increased their uncertainty about the outlook for the labor market. Equity price indexes increased, on net, despite an initial sharp decline following the Brexit vote, and corporate bond spreads declined on balance. Participants discussed the implications of recent economic and financial developments for the economic outlook and the risks attending the outlook. For any operation that involves standalone spot or forward transactions in foreign currencies:A. Approval of such operation is required as follows: Although payrolls for state and local governments expanded in July and August, nominal construction spending by these governments declined in July. Yield spreads for securities backed by credit card and auto loans over Treasury securities of comparable maturities were little changed on balance. Participants noted that economic growth in many foreign economies remained subdued, and that inflation rates abroad generally were still quite low. For any operation that involves standalone spot or forward transactions in foreign currencies:A. Approval of such operation is required as follows: Reports from District contacts on both manufacturing and services were also generally consistent with moderate growth in economic activity overall. Credit bureau data on loan originations and credit limits suggested that this tightening was most pronounced in the subprime segment of the market. Although the hurricanes depressed payroll employment in September, the unemployment rate, which was less affected by the storms, declined further. For any operation that involves standalone spot or forward transactions in foreign currencies:A. Approval of such operation is required as follows: Incoming data suggested that economic activity abroad continued to expand at a solid pace and that this expansion was broad based across countries. Recent data suggest that growth rates of household spending and business fixed investment have moderated from their strong fourth-quarter readings. In addition, a few observed that the neutral level of the federal funds rate might currently be lower than their estimates of its longer-run level. Household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year. Some contacts indicated that while input costs were higher, it appeared that the pass-through of these higher costs to consumer prices was limited. Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year. Some participants expressed an interest in learning more about possible options for new ceiling tools to provide firmer control of the policy rate. Exports declined a little, with decreases in exports of agricultural products and capital goods, although exports of industrial supplies increased. The U.S. dollar appreciated modestly; although declines in U.S. yields weighed on the dollar, deteriorating global risk sentiment provided support. Household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year. Household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year. Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year. For any operation that involves standalone spot or forward transactions in foreign currencies:A. Approval of such operation is required as follows: Total PCE price inflation was forecast to run a bit below core inflation over the next three years, reflecting projected declines in energy prices. Participants cited various factors as likely to contribute to the step-down, including slower foreign growth and waning effects of fiscal stimulus. These factors were thought to have helped buoy consumer and business confidence or to have mitigated short-term downside risks to the real economy. Equity prices fell notably over the first few weeks of the period, primarily in response to the escalation of trade tensions with China and Mexico. Participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate. Moreover, participants generally expected that trade uncertainty and sluggish global growth would continue to damp investment spending and exports. Participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate. For any operation that involves standalone spot or forward transactions in foreign currencies:A. Approval of such operation is required as follows: Available monthly data suggested that imports fell significantly, led by declines in consumer goods and automobiles, while exports were about flat. Yields on nominal Treasury securities plummeted across the maturity spectrum, with the 10- and 30-year yields reaching all-time lows at some point. This reading highlighted possible vulnerabilities in mortgage servicers, insurance companies, and large, highly leveraged financial intermediaries. The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics declined over the past two months but remained well above the national average. Foreign economic activity plunged in the second quarter as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated restrictive measures to contain it. Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in September, but the gain was markedly below the even larger increases seen in previous months. Uncertainty about additional U.S. fiscal stimulus and the outcome of the U.S. presidential election also caused some asset price volatility abroad. However, the uncertainty surrounding earning prospects was reportedly making many business owners less willing to take on debt at prevailing terms. Market participants had highlighted that uncertainty nevertheless remained high and had pointed to several prominent risks to the economic outlook. Short-term delinquencies and defaults remained relatively elevated but significantly lower than the levels observed following the financial crisis. For any operation that involves standalone spot or forward transactions in foreign currencies:A. Approval of such operation is required as follows: Spreads on agency CMBS ticked down, on net, and issuance remained elevated through December, although below its recent historical high in October. Total PCE price inflation was 1.6 percent over the 12 months ending in February and continued to be held down by low rates of resource utilization. The staff noted that corporate bond spreads had declined notably since late last year and were at the lower ends of their historical distributions. Lower term premiums appeared to be a significant component of the declines, as reflected by lower implied volatility on longer-term interest rates. For commercial real estate (CRE) financed through capital markets, financing conditions remained mostly accommodative over the intermeeting period. In the euro area and the United Kingdom, higher-than-expected inflation data contributed to the rise in yields and inflation compensation measures. A couple of others noted the risk that persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity growth could trigger inflationary wageprice dynamics. Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. For any operation that involves standalone spot or forward transactions in foreign currencies:A. Approval of such operation is required as follows: Far forward real yields moved higher over the period, with much of the increase following the release of the minutes for the December FOMC meeting. Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. The effective federal funds rate and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate generally held steady at 8 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively. They further judged that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be warranted to achieve the Committee's objectives. The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics moved lower, though both rates remained noticeably higher than the national average. The private-sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, edged lower in April but remained at a high level. A couple of participants raised the possibility that tight labor markets would spur investment in automation by firms, boosting labor productivity. Nominal wage growth continued to be rapid and broad based, with average hourly earnings having risen 5.1 percent over the 12 months ending in June. The number of home-purchase and refinance mortgage originations were about flat in August and September but down significantly from late last year. The market-implied federal funds rate path for 2023 was little changed, on net, during the intermeeting period but fell moderately beyond mid-2024. Interest rates on existing credit cards continued to increase in recent months, and interest rates on new auto loans also rose through mid-January. A few participants remarked that recent failures of companies involved in crypto finance have had a limited effect on the broader financial system. Members concurred that the statement should note that the expansion remained solid despite elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions. M2 expanded at a somewhat faster pace in the fourth quarter than had been predicted from historical relationships with income and opportunity costs. To date, unit labor costs were not placing pressure on inflation, and high profit margins left firms a considerable buffer to absorb cost increases. While manufacturing growth for the first quarter as a whole slowed from the rapid pace of the fourth quarter, it exceeded that of the previous year. Domestic nonfinancial sector debt was estimated to have grown at a robust pace in the first quarter, down only slightly from the brisk pace of 2005. And, even if nominal wages should accelerate somewhat, relatively wide profit margins could buffer the effect on prices of final goods and services. The pass-through of the substantial rise in energy prices could account for a considerable part of the step-up in core inflation in recent quarters. Growth of nonfinancial domestic debt was estimated to have slowed a little in the third quarter from the average pace in the first half of the year. TIPS yields fell less than their nominal counterparts, implying modest declines in inflation compensation both at the five-year and longer horizons. In this context, the Committee judged that some inflation risk remained and said that it would continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. Real outlays for nondurable and durable consumer goods, including automobiles, were estimated to have declined, on average, in January and February. Most other categories of imports dropped in December and January on net, with especially large declines in imports of automotive and consumer goods. In discussing the external sector of the economy, some participants indicated that net exports remained a notable source of support for the economy. Manufacturing output also fell in April and was unchanged in May; over the two months, factory production slowed across a broad range of industries. Over the intermeeting period, spreads of rates on conforming residential mortgages over comparable-maturity Treasury securities remained about flat. Tight conditions in mortgage markets over the summer continued to restrain housing demand, especially for borrowers seeking nonconforming mortgages. Measures of consumer sentiment dropped in October to near or below their low levels of midyear, with the Conference Board measure exceptionally low. The unemployment rate climbed to 6.7 percent in November, while the labor force participation rate fell after remaining steady for much of the year. Sales of existing single-family homes changed little, although a drop in pending home sales in October pointed to further declines in the near term. In other cases, the Federal Reserve eventually may have to take a more active role in scaling back programs by adjusting their terms and conditions. Expenditures were being cut substantially for a wide range of capital equipment, and spending on nonresidential structures had recently turned down. As of April 22, the System's total assets and liabilities were close to $2.2 trillion, about $130 billion higher than just before the March meeting. Rates for conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose on net between late April and late June but remained below the levels seen over most of 2008. Purchasing managers indexes rebounded from the exceptionally low levels reached in the first quarter, and industrial production stabilized somewhat. The expected path of the federal funds rate implied by futures prices was largely unchanged by the release of the Committee's statement and minutes. Over the intermeeting period, functioning in the market for Treasury securities generally improved and trading picked up, but some strains remained. Participants noted the considerable uncertainty surrounding estimates of the output and unemployment gaps and the extent of their effects on prices. The on-the-run liquidity premium for the 10-year Treasury note was little changed at elevated levels, although it was well below its peak last fall. The staff interpreted the increases in prices of energy and nonmarket services that recently boosted consumer price inflation as largely transitory. Spreads on A2/P2-rated commercial paper (CP) and AA-rated asset-backed CP held steady at the low end of the range that has prevailed since mid-2007. The drop in commercial real estate loans persisted, reflecting weak fundamentals that limited originations as well as charge-offs of existing loans. The central banks of a number of EMEs, including Brazil, Chile, India, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand, increased policy interest rates. Conditions in short-term funding markets continued to improve following the recent stresses related to concerns about financial stability in Europe. The softer tone of incoming economic data suggested that the underlying level of demand was weaker than projected at the time of the August meeting. Although inventory-sales ratios rose during the third quarter, survey data implied that few businesses perceived inventory stocks as being too high. The spread between mortgage rates and MBS yields dropped back, reversing the widening of the spread that occurred over the preceding several months. Although consumer credit contracted in the third quarter, the decline was the smallest since late 2008, and consumer credit edged higher in October. Participants noted that many of the factors that contributed to the recent apparent rise in structural unemployment were likely to recede over time. The unemployment rate decreased to 9.4 percent in December, but this decline in part reflected a further drop in the labor force participation rate. In December and early January, survey measures of households' long-term inflation expectations stayed in the range that has prevailed for some time. Participants' judgment that the economic recovery was on a firmer footing was supported by the strength in household spending in the fourth quarter. On net, expectations for the federal funds rate, along with yields on nominal Treasury securities, were little changed over the intermeeting period. Most participants saw changes in the target for the federal funds rate as the preferred active tool for tightening monetary policy when appropriate. Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms was robust in March, and indicators of the credit quality of nonfinancial firms improved further. Delinquency rates for consumer debt edged down further in recent months, with delinquency rates on some categories moving back to pre-crisis levels. The run-up in energy prices, as well as an increase in prices of other commodities and imported goods, had boosted both headline and core inflation. A few participants noted that a reduction in the interest rate paid on excess reserve balances could also be helpful in easing financial conditions. A number of participants judged that a reduction would result in at least marginally lower money market rates and could help stimulate bank lending. Monthly U.S. consumer price inflation picked up in July and August after slowing in May and June, but remained a bit lower than earlier in the year. Meeting participants observed that financial markets remained volatile over the intermeeting period in large part because of developments in Europe. Reports from business contacts indicated that activity in the manufacturing, energy, and agricultural sectors continued to advance in recent months. Another participant cited reports from business contacts indicating that credit standards in mortgage lending were becoming somewhat less stringent. Initial claims for unemployment insurance trended lower over the intermeeting period and were at a level consistent with further moderate job gains. Moreover, households' net worth grew in the fourth quarter of last year and likely was boosted further by gains in equity values thus far this year. Staff Review of the Economic SituationThe information reviewed at the April 24-25 meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding moderately. Business fixed investment had continued to advance, and household spending appeared to be rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year. On balance, the nominal Treasury yield curve steepened over the intermeeting period, with yields on longer-dated Treasury securities rising notably. Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index fell in early August to levels not seen since the middle of 2007; it subsequently partially retraced. For the duration of this program, the Committee directs the Desk to suspend its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues. For the duration of this program, the Committee directs the Desk to suspend its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues. Measures of firms' hiring plans improved, the rate of job openings increased slightly, and the rate of long-duration unemployment declined a little. In addition, financial markets were affected for a time by uncertainties about raising the federal debt limit and resolving the government shutdown. Financial quotes suggested that markets moved out the date at which they expected to see the Committee first increase the federal funds rate target. The staff detailed a possible approach for implementing and communicating monetary policy once the Committee begins to tighten the stance of policy. The staff continued to project that real GDP would expand at a faster pace in the second half of this year and over the next two years than in 2013. As a consequence, they updated the language in the statement to indicate that inflation had been running below the Committee's longer-run objective. Nominal business spending for new nonresidential construction decreased in August, and vacancy rates for nonresidential buildings remained elevated. Market-based measures of inflation compensation declined further, while survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained stable. Nonetheless, many participants agreed that the use of term RRP operations during the period of policy tightening could be useful in some situations. Consumer price inflation moved further below the FOMC's longer-run objective of 2 percent, held down by continuing large decreases in energy prices. The fall had occurred despite the strengthening U.S. economic outlook and market expectations that policy normalization could begin later this year. The deputy manager followed with a review of System open market operations conducted during the period since the Committee met on March 17-18, 2015. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low, while survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable. Many participants noted that measures of inflation averaged over several months or more continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low, while survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable. The manager also discussed System open market operations conducted by the Open Market Desk during the period since the Committee met on April 28-29. Growth in real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) appeared to pick up early in the second quarter from its modest pace in the previous quarter. Respondents again saw the September 2015 FOMC meeting as the most likely time for the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate. Members generally agreed that additional information on the outlook would be necessary before deciding to implement an increase in the target range. In manufacturing, the auto industry remained a bright spot, but the appreciation of the dollar was still restraining production of goods for export. Consistent with this downside risk to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside. Issuance of investment-grade corporate bonds and institutional leveraged loans remained solid, buoyed by demand to finance mergers and acquisitions. Gradual adjustments in the federal funds rate would also allow policymakers to assess how the economy was responding to increases in interest rates. Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses remained accommodative for firms of higher credit quality but tightened somewhat for riskier firms. Nevertheless, recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending were consistent with a pickup in real PCE growth in the coming months. Market-based estimates of the probability of a hike in the federal funds rate at the June FOMC meeting were variable during the intermeeting period. Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside. One-month-ahead option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index--the VIX--fell, returning to the lower end of its distribution of the past few years. Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside. In addition, it was pointed out that the upward trend in investment in intellectual property products was a positivee in the outlook for investment. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken pursuant to paragraph 1 above shall, unless otherwise authorized by the Committee, be conducted:A. Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside. Measures of longer-run inflation expectations from the Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were unchanged in October. Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside. Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken pursuant to paragraph 1 above shall, unless otherwise authorized by the Committee, be conducted:A. Altogether, the change in real net exports was estimated to have made a substantial nagativee contribution to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter. Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside. The unemployment rate edged back down to 4.7 percent in February, and the labor force participation rate rose over the first two months of the year. Meanwhile, spreads of yields on bonds issued by nonfinancial corporations over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities were little changed. Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside. Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside. Sales of new homes increased notably over the two months ending in September, although sales of existing homes decreased somewhat over that period. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken pursuant to paragraph 1 above shall, unless otherwise authorized by the Committee, be conducted:A. Total industrial production increased over the two months ending in December, with broad-based gains in manufacturing, mining, and utilities output. On the upside, recent fiscal policy changes could lead to a greater expansion in economic activity over the next few years than the staff projected. Many participants reported considerable optimism among the business contacts in their Districts, consistent with a firming in business expenditures. Recent data suggested that growth rates of household spending and business fixed investment had moderated from their strong fourth-quarter readings. On the upside, recent fiscal policy changes could lead to a greater expansion in economic activity over the next few years than the staff projected. Gross issuance of municipal bonds in April and May was solid, as issuance continued to recover from the slow pace recorded at the start of the year. On the upside, recent fiscal policy changes could lead to a greater expansion in economic activity over the next few years than the staff projected. Payrolls had increased strongly in October, and measures of labor market tightness such as rates of job openings and quits continued to be elevated. Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market also remained accommodative for most borrowers, but the demand for mortgage credit softened. Participants agreed to continue to monitor financial market developments and assess the implications of these developments for the economic outlook. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken pursuant to paragraph 1 above shall, unless otherwise authorized by the Committee, be conducted:A. Core PCE price inflation was still expected to step up to 2 percent over this year as a whole and then to run at that level through the medium term. In addition, a few participants noted that recent declines in oil or gasoline prices had damped plans for capital expenditures in the energy sector. The employment cost index for private-sector workers increased 3 percent over the 12 months ending in December, somewhat faster than a year earlier. Consistent with reports about a potential trade deal, stock prices of firms with greater exposure to China generally outperformed the S&P 500 index. On the downside, the recent softening in a number of economic indicators could be the harbinger of a substantial deterioration in economic activity. Moreover, trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant nagativee effects on U.S. economic growth. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that the contribution of net exports to real GDP growth in the first quarter was about 1 percentage point. Moreover, trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant nagativee effects on U.S. economic growth. In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing conditions remained generally accommodative despite a modest deceleration in bank loan growth. Participants' Discussion of Recent Money Market DevelopmentsThe manager pro tem provided a summary of the most recent developments in money markets. A few participants observed that valuations in equity and bond markets were high by historical standards and that CRE valuations were also elevated. In addition to helping keep reserves ample, repo operations likely have reduced pressures in money markets and the dispersion in money market rates. Both the rate of private-sector job openings and the rate of quits edged down in September, but these readings were still at fairly elevated levels. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken pursuant to paragraph 1 above shall, unless otherwise authorized by the Committee, be conducted:A. As a result, the Chair, in consultation with the FOMC, instructed the Desk to conduct purchases of Treasury securities across a range of maturities. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in February, and the core CPI increased 2.4 percent over that same period. Output in the mining sector, which includes crude oil extraction, also decreased significantly in the wake of the recent declines in crude oil prices. On the one hand, a number of participants judged that there was a substantial likelihood of additional waves of outbreak in the near or medium term. As term U.S. dollar liquidity swaps matured, the amounts outstanding fell to around $120 billion, less than a third of the peak reached in late May. In light of this assessment, all participants considered it appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to혻1/4 percent. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve increased holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS at the same pace as during the previous intermeeting period. Amid historically low corporate bond yields, gross issuance of both investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds was strong in July and August. Amid notable equity market gains in August, gross equity issuance was robust, as seasoned offerings strengthened to about double their typical pace. Housing-sector activity advanced in the third quarter, with real residential investment and home sales both moving above their first quarter levels. Domestic demand supported the recovery, and in Asia there was also a strong rebound of exports, especially of electronics and, more recently, autos. On balance, prices of global risky assets increased notably, implied volatility dropped sharply, and the dollar depreciated against most currencies. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken pursuant to paragraph 1 above shall, unless otherwise authorized by the Committee, be conducted:A. Consumer spending appeared to be increasing in the first quarter at a pace considerably faster, on balance, than in the fourth quarter of last year. Participants also observed that residential construction continued to be solid and home sales remained robust in part because of low interest rates. Regarding financial leverage, the staff noted that bank capital ratios remained above pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter, but risks remained. On net, European longer-term government bond yields were little changed even as U.S. yields declined, and the broad dollar index decreased modestly. In their discussion of current conditions, participants noted that progress on vaccinations had reduced the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. Market participants noted information in the public domain about measures the Federal Reserve and the Treasury could take around a debt limit event. Several participants indicated that they preferred to proceed with a more rapid moderation of purchases than described in the illustrative examples. In the municipal bond market, issuance was robust in October and November, and financing conditions remained accommodative, supported by low yields. In the residential mortgage market, financing conditions stayed accommodative, particularly for borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken pursuant to paragraph 1 above shall, unless otherwise authorized by the Committee, be conducted:A. The staff expected that the size of the associated deferred asset would increase over time until net income turned positivee, likely in a few years. Many participants emphasized that the cost of taking too little action to bring down inflation likely outweighed the cost of taking too much action. A slower pace in these circumstances would better allow the Committee to assess progress toward its goals of maximum employment and price stability. Participants agreed that the labor market remained very tight and assessed that labor demand substantially exceeded the supply of available workers. At its January meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to raise the target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4쩍 percent. While utility output surged in February and moved up a bit more in March, these increases only partly reversed the weather-related plunge in January. Over the past twelve months, inventories relative to shipments and sales had moved down moderately on balance, extending the long-run downward trend. Some reports indicated that speculative building of homes had dropped off considerably, but inventories of unsold homes still seemed to be expanding. Although alternative measures of labor compensation provided divergent readings, growth of total compensation on balance appeared to remain moderate. The FOMC's policy decision and the accompanying statement were about in line with market expectations, and reactions in financial markets were muted. A number of members noted that the recent policy moves could readily be reversed if circumstances evolved in a manner that would warrant such action. Nonfinancial business debt continued to expand strongly, supported by solid bond issuance and by a small rebound in the issuance of commercial paper. Several participants remarked that, unlike residential real estate, commercial and industrial real estate activity remained solid in their Districts. \"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. The ratio of wealth to income likely declined again in the second quarter, as equity prices declined, on balance, and house prices continued to fall. In longer-term credit markets, yields on investment-grade corporate bonds were not much changed, but yields on speculative-grade bonds rose somewhat. \"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. Conditions in the labor market continued to deteriorate rapidly in December: Private payroll employment fell sharply, and the unemployment rate rose. The staff again expected that unemployment would rise substantially through the beginning of 2010 before edging down over the remainder of that year. One member expressed the view that it would be best to expand holdings of U.S. Treasury securities rather than to expand targeted liquidity programs. The first-quarter data also offered a few tentative signs that the deceleration of economic activity in emerging markets might have started to abate. Retail money market mutual funds and small time deposits contracted in both months, probably in response to declining interest rates on these assets. Although the fundamental determinants of investment in E&S remained weak, conditions appeared less unfavorable, on balance, than earlier in the year. Recent indicators of economic activity in the advanced foreign economies suggested that the pace of contraction in those countries moderated further. In most emerging market economies, particularly in Asia, economic activity rebounded in the second quarter; however, output declined again in Mexico. The Manager also reported on System open market operations in agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) during the intermeeting period. The continued gains in manufacturing production were bolstered by growing demand from foreign trading partners, especially emerging market economies. One strategy considered in the staff presentation was a continuation of the current practice, which would normalize the balance sheet very gradually. The moderation in spending appeared, on balance, to be aligning the pace of consumption with recent trends in income, wealth, and consumer sentiment. Moreover, participants saw some indications that credit conditions for households and smaller businesses were beginning to improve, albeit gradually. Private businesses increased employment modestly in August, but the length of the workweek was unchanged and the unemployment rate remained elevated. Capacity utilization in manufacturing ticked up further in August from its mid-2009 low, but it was still substantially below its longer-run average. Yield spreads relative to German bunds on the 10-year sovereign bonds of Greece, Ireland, and Portugal widened to near-record levels over the period. Several other central banks tightened monetary policy over the intermeeting period, including those of Chile, India, Indonesia, Sweden, and Thailand. Several participants reported feedback from business contacts who were delaying hiring until the economic and regulatory outlook became more certain. However, others thought that additional accommodation would be warranted only if the outlook worsened and the odds of deflation increased materially. Rebuilding of dealers' stocks of motor vehicles accounted for part of the step-up, but some of it likely reflected another large increase in imports. Participants generally agreed that the most likely economic outcome would be a gradual pickup in growth with slow progress toward maximum employment. In discussing the staff presentation, meeting participants mentioned various factors that were seen as influencing the path of the unemployment rate. In the discussion of normalization, some participants also noted their preferences about the longer-run framework for monetary policy implementation. Dealers also reported that the demand for funding had increased over the same period for a broad range of securities, with the exception of equities. The strains in these markets eased after legislation to raise the debt ceiling and to cut the federal budget deficit was signed into law on August 2. Most members also anticipated that inflation would settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's mandate. Overall U.S. consumer price inflation, as measured by the PCE price index, was more moderate in the third quarter than in the first half of the year. The unemployment rate dropped to 8.6 percent in November, and private nonfarm employment continued to increase moderately during the past two months. In the government sector, real federal defense purchases appeared to have stepped down in October and November from their level in the third quarter. Delinquency rates for consumer credit remained low, partly reflecting a shift in the composition of borrowers toward those with higher credit scores. In contrast, a few participants observed that the marked drop in yields on longer-term U.S. Treasury securities could provide some impetus to growth. Both nominal shipments and new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft declined in July, and the backlog of unfilled orders decreased. Consumer credit continued to expand at a solid pace because of the ongoing expansion in auto and student loans; credit card debt remained about flat. Over the period, rates on primary mortgages and yields on agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) rose about in line with the 10-year Treasury yield. The Manager described the proposed arrangements, noting that the Committee would still be asked to review participation in the arrangements annually. Another suggestion for enhancing communications was to use the Summary of Economic Projections to provide more information about participants' views. Renewed export demand and a buildup in auto inventories, which may be reversed in 2014, were cited as contributing to the recent gains in production. Partly reflecting these conditions, credit card balances stayed about flat through January, while auto and student loans continued to expand briskly. For many participants, the outlook for economic activity over coming quarters had changed little, on balance, since the time of the December meeting. Household spending appears to be rising moderately and business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow. Reflecting these and other developments, yields on nominal Treasury securities rose somewhat and equity prices edged up over the intermeeting period. It was noted, however, that the characterization of labor market underutilization might have to be changed if progress in the labor market continued. Household spending appears to be rising moderately and business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow. Market-based measures of inflation compensation declined somewhat, while survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained stable. Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft were little changed, on net, in August and September after a solid increase in July. Among emerging market economies, GDP growth remained strong in the third quarter in China and Korea and indicators for Mexico were favorable as well. Market-based measures of inflation compensation declined somewhat, while survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained stable. In addition, the manager reviewed the implications of recent foreign central bank policy actions for the international portion of the SOMA portfolio. Participants generally regarded the net effect of the recent decline in energy prices as likely to be positivee for economic activity and employment. Industrial production rose at a robust pace in the fourth quarter, with a strong increase in manufacturing output and a modest gain in mining output. Participants generally regarded the net effect of the recent decline in energy prices as likely to be positivee for economic activity and employment. One factor behind that moderation was a slowdown in the growth of exports, and members decided that the statement should explicitly note that factor. They cited anecdotal reports of firms having concerns about retaining workers and facing difficulties in filling even medium- and lower-skilled jobs. Recent readings on headline consumer price inflation reflected only small increases in core inflation and renewed weakness in consumer energy prices. Some other participants, however, expressed concerns about delaying the start of normalizing the target range for the federal funds rate much longer. However, they also recognized that the appropriate path for the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. However, members observed that if the recent tightening of global financial conditions was sustained, it could be a factor amplifying downside risks. The components of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its estimate of PCE rose moderately in November. The Census Bureau's advance trade estimates for December suggested a narrowing of the trade deficit in goods, as imports increased less than exports. The broad dollar index increased immediately after the December FOMC meeting but subsequently retraced its gains and ended the period slightly lower. Participants generally characterized their economic forecasts and their judgments about monetary policy as little changed since the December meeting. Inflation in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) continued to rise, largely reflecting increases in retail energy prices and currency depreciation. Inflation, measured as the 12-month change in the headline PCE price index, had been running close to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective. The Committee expected to begin implementing a balance sheet normalization program in 2017, provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated. Thus, as in the June projection, the staff projected that real GDP would expand at a modestly faster pace than potential output in 2017 through 2019. At the same time, financing conditions for households and nonfinancial businesses continued to provide support for growth in spending and investment. Staff Economic OutlookThe U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the September FOMC meeting was broadly similar to the previous forecast. Although the effects of the recent hurricanes led to a reported decline in payroll employment in September, the unemployment rate decreased further. A couple of participants noted that broad improvements in labor market conditions over the past several years were evident across demographic groups. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. The projection for inflation over the medium term was revised up slightly, primarily reflecting tighter resource utilization in the January forecast. Nonetheless, they again stated that the actual path for the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by the incoming data. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. Since the January FOMC meeting, foreign equity prices moved notably lower, on net, and generally declined more in the AFEs than in the United States. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. Spreads on term money market instruments relative to comparable-maturity OIS rates were still larger than usual in some segments of the money market. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. Reports from business contacts confirmed a robust pace of expansion in several sectors of the economy, including energy, manufacturing, and services. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. In addition, concerns about trade tensions between the United States and China were the focus of a great deal of attention among market participants. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market OperationsThe SOMA manager reviewed developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period. Nominal defense spending in October and November pointed to solid growth in real federal purchases, although spending data for December were delayed. Total labor compensation per hour in the business sector increased 2.9 percent over the four quarters of 2018, about the same rate as a year earlier. Market participants assigned greater probability to a lower target range of the federal funds rate than to a higher one beyond the next few meetings. Staff Economic OutlookThe projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting was revised down somewhat on balance. Industrial production (IP) was unchanged in June, as a decrease in the output of utilities offset increases in the output of manufacturers and mines. Separately, the staff noted that market liquidity was, overall, in good shape, although sudden price drops had become more frequent in some markets. Reports from business contacts pointed to continued strong labor demand, with many firms reporting difficulty finding workers to meet current demand. A few participants noted the possibility of resuming trend growth of the balance sheet to help stabilize the level of reserves in the banking system. The staff presented two potential approaches for conducting repo operations if the Committee decided to maintain an ongoing role for such operations. In the October SLOOS, banks left their lending standards basically unchanged for most residential real estate loan categories over the third quarter. Market prices appeared to respond mainly to signs of stabilization in the U.S. and global economies and to developments associated with trade policy. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market OperationsThe SOMA manager reviewed developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period. Foreign economic indicators for the more recent period, following the spread of the virus to the rest of the world, were generally not yet available. All participants viewed the near-term U.S. economic outlook as having deteriorated sharply in recent weeks and as having become profoundly uncertain. However, the Federal Reserve's announcements and start-ups of emergency liquidity facilities appeared to improve conditions in many of these markets. That said, compared with early this year, foreign equity indexes stayed sharply lower, and option-implied equity volatility abroad remained elevated. The upcoming financial stress tests for banks were seen as important for measuring the ability of large banks to withstand future downside scenarios. The consumer price index (CPI) inched up 0.1 percent over the 12 months ending in May, while core CPI inflation was 1.2 percent over the same period. In contrast, output in the mining sector, which includes crude oil extraction, decreased further, reflecting the effects of still-low crude oil prices. Regarding the labor market, many participants commented that the pace of employment gains, which was quite strong in May and June, had likely slowed. The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance was only slightly lower in early December than it had been in late October. Federal defense spending continued to rise in October and November, although federal employment declined with the layoff of temporary census workers. The 5-year and 5-to-10-year measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities rose above their pre-pandemic levels. Agency commercial mortgage-backed security (CMBS) spreads remained narrow amid strong issuance in October, while non-agency CMBS spreads ticked down. That said, participants agreed that the path ahead remained highly uncertain and that the economy remained far from the Committee's longer-run goals. The Treasury market functioned well over most of the period, although measures of market liquidity deteriorated somewhat toward the end of February. Assets under management (AUM) of government money market funds (MMFs) rose over the intermeeting period, whereas AUM of prime MMFs declined somewhat. In March 2020, repo operations worked in concert with other measures to manage shocks to financial markets by stabilizing Treasury market conditions. State and local government purchases looked to be increasing significantly, as the payrolls of these governments expanded solidly over April and May. Market expectations for the federal funds rate path over the medium term, as implied by OIS quotes unadjusted for term premiums, declined moderately. Concerns about the worldwide spread of the Delta variant weighed somewhat on risk sentiment in global financial markets over the intermeeting period. The manager provided a brief update on the new repurchase agreement (repo) facilities that the Committee had announced following its meeting in July. In the residential mortgage market, financing conditions remained accommodative particularly for borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria. Option-implied volatility on short-dated interest rates increased, reportedly reflecting greater uncertainty over the path of the federal funds rate. Over the intermeeting period, U.S. equity indexes rose and the one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500?봳he VIX?봣ell to post-pandemic lows. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months, but the summer's rise in COVID-19 cases had slowed their recovery. Expectations for tighter monetary policy ahead, as well as an easing of COVID-related concerns, were cited as contributing to the increase in yields. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months but are being affected by the recent sharp rise in COVID-19 cases. Market-implied policy rates one year forward rose notably across many advanced foreign economies (AFEs), extending increases seen over recent months. Real PCE appeared to be rising at a faster pace in the first quarter of 2022 than in the fourth quarter of 2021 as social distancing unwound further. Available indicators suggested that real government purchases were little changed in the first quarter after declining in the fourth quarter of 2021. A few participants indicated that some of their business contacts were reportedly hesitant to expand capacity or had postponed construction projects. Regarding trade, real imports of goods stepped back in April from their exceptional strength in March, driven by a decline in consumer goods imports. Real yields increased more than their nominal counterparts, while inflation compensation implied by Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities declined. Money market fund (MMF) net yields across all fund types rose notably, as increases in administered rates passed through to money market instruments. Participants stressed the need to adjust the stance of policy in response to incoming information regarding the evolution of these and other factors. They also agreed that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. They also agreed that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. This prospect could require money market participants to be more responsive to shifting liquidity conditions and to plan ahead for the coming period. They also agreed that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. Mining output--which includes oil and natural gas extraction--slipped in February after registering robust gains in each of the previous three months. Greater uncertainty about inflation pressures and the needed policy response had perhaps contributed to a reassessment of risks by investors globally. Still, the overhang of unsold homes remained historically high, and price appreciation of existing homes continued to slow through the second quarter. In the multifamily sector, starts in July were in line with readings thus far this year and at the low end of the fairly narrow range seen since 1997. The labor force participation rate was unchanged, on average, in the third quarter, and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.7 percent in September.   Meeting participants also mentioned that while financial market conditions had improved, the functioning of some markets remained somewhat impaired.   Commercial real estate lending at banks, however, continued to advance briskly in January and February, while the rise in consumer loans was moderate. The increase in exports was broad-based, with strong increases in exports of industrial supplies, capital and consumer goods, and automotive products. Conditions in the market for Treasury repurchase agreements appeared to improve somewhat, but conditions were still poor for lower-quality collateral. In the business sector, real spending on equipment and software declined in the second quarter as outlays on transportation equipment dropped sharply. Over the intermeeting period, spreads of rates on conforming residential mortgages over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities moved higher. Business spending on equipment and software appeared to have declined again in the third quarter, and indicators of investment in structures weakened. Small time deposits increased briskly in September and early October as banks and thrifts reportedly continued to bid aggressively for these deposits. On October 22, the rate on excess reserves was adjusted to be the lowest target federal funds rate during the maintenance period less 35 basis points. Measures of longer-term inflation expectations edged up in early January, but remained lower than they had been in all but the last few weeks of 2008. Business debt expanded only modestly, given the high cost of borrowing, tighter lending terms, and the deterioration in the macroeconomic environment. The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time. In light of this development, it was widely agreed that exports were not likely to be a source of support for U.S. economic activity in the near term. Moreover, monthly surveys of business conditions, sentiment, and capital spending plans pointed to a moderate rise in business spending going forward. While these developments were positivee, participants noted several factors that likely would continue to restrain the expansion in economic activity. In the labor market, layoffs subsided noticeably in the final months of last year, but the unemployment rate remained elevated and hiring stayed weak. Financial market conditions remained supportive of economic growth over the intermeeting period, and short-term funding markets were generally stable. Members recognized that references to \"purchases\" of securities would need to be modified as the completion of the asset purchase programs draws near. The staff noted that the Board had recently approved changes to Regulation D that would be necessary for the establishment of a term deposit facility. However, both new home sales and existing home sales were likely boosted, at least in part, by the anticipated expiration of the homebuyer tax credit. Financial stock prices moved about in line with broader indexes, and credit default swap spreads for large financial institutions narrowed moderately. Indicators of household net worth were mixed; home prices moved down in July, while equity prices inched up, on balance, over the intermeeting period. The interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages remained essentially unchanged over the intermeeting period at a historically low level. Most other major categories of exports were little changed in July, although exports of automotive products posted their first decline since May 2009. As a result, the rate of capacity utilization in manufacturing was essentially unchanged in January, and it remained well below its 1972-2010 average. Household net worth rose in the fourth quarter, as the increase in equity values during that period more than offset the further fall in house prices. Several other participants preferred instead that the pace of sales be a key policy tool and be varied actively in response to changes in the outlook. Issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities picked up in the first quarter, although commercial real estate loans at banks continued to run off. However, several participants noted that such thresholds could be confusing in the absence of a clear expression of the Committee's longer-term goals. The U.S. international trade deficit was virtually the same in August as it was in July, as both exports and imports moved down only by small amounts. European bank CDS spreads remained elevated, and these institutions continued to face somewhat strained conditions in short-term bank funding markets. Reductions in exports of industrial supplies and consumer goods, led by a few particularly volatile components, outweighed the gains in capital goods. Broad equity price indexes increased more than 6 percent, on net, over the intermeeting period, and option-implied equity volatility declined notably. The Committee also anticipates that over coming quarters, inflation will run at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. Consumer sentiment was little changed in February, and households remained downbeat about both the economic outlook and their own income and finances. Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms was still solid in January and February, boosted by continued strength in initial public offerings. Consumer credit rose in recent months, with the growth in nonrevolving credit led by continued rapid expansion of government-originated student loans. Inventories in most industries looked to be fairly well aligned with sales in recent months, although motor vehicle stocks were still relatively lean. Indicators of funding market stresses remained muted, as many banks obtained funds from the European Central Bank (ECB) rather than interbank markets. Several observed that recent declines in gasoline prices would increase households' real incomes and could boost consumer spending in coming quarters. A number of participants expressed the view that structural changes in the labor market were not sufficient to explain the high level of unemployment. The staff also discussed the potential implications of additional asset purchases for the evolution of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and income. Participants saw recent price developments as consistent with inflation remaining at or below the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium run. Nonrevolving credit continued to increase at a robust pace because of growth in student and auto loans, while revolving credit moved roughly sideways. In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members saw the economic outlook as relatively little changed since the previous meeting. The production of motor vehicles and parts rose considerably in February, and there were also widespread increases in factory output in other sectors. This caution appeared to have resulted in jobs remaining vacant for substantially longer than would normally be the case, given the unemployment rate. Consumer prices excluding food and energy were flat in March, and their increase from 12 months earlier was similar to that for total consumer prices. In May, nominal retail sales, excluding those at motor vehicle and parts outlets, increased briskly, while light motor vehicle sales moved up solidly. Among the factors viewed as supporting consumption were improvements in household balance sheets and in the job market, as well as low interest rates. Although the manufacturing sector slowed considerably during the spring, contacts in several Districts reported that activity turned up more recently. Several participants worried that higher mortgage rates and bond yields could slow the recovery in the housing market and restrain business expansion. A couple of participants expressed concerns that some financial institutions might not be well positioned to weather a rapid run-up in interest rates. The monetary base continued to expand rapidly, primarily reflecting the rise in reserve balances resulting from the Federal Reserve's asset purchases. The gains in exports were fairly widespread across categories and were led by sales of consumer goods, industrial supplies, and agricultural products. Although the recovery in the housing sector had slowed somewhat in recent months, a number of participants reported solid activity in their Districts. One participant voiced concern about high levels of margin debt and of equity market valuations as well as a notable shift into commodity investments. Asset prices moved in response to economic data releases that were, on balance, a little stronger than expected and to Federal Reserve communications.

This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. However, reflecting in part the deterioration in market sentiment, the expected path for the federal funds rate implied by market quotes shifted down. Issuance of collateralized loan obligations declined but remained elevated; 2014 was the strongest year on record for the issuance of such securities. However, other participants put some weight on the possibility that the decline in inflation compensation reflected a reduction in expected inflation. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.

The deputy manager followed with a review of System open market operations conducted during the period since the Committee met on January 27-28, 2015. Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) appeared to decelerate somewhat going into the first quarter after rising markedly in the fourth quarter. Both compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector and the employment cost index rose 2-1/4 percent over the year ending in the fourth quarter. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. A number of reasons were advanced for believing that the weakness in spending observed during the first quarter was partly or even largely transitory. Participants discussed downside risks to economic growth, and a few indicated that, in their assessment, such risks had risen since the March meeting.

This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. Spreads on 10-year triple-B-rated and speculative-grade corporate bonds over comparable-maturity Treasury securities widened somewhat over the period. The easing of lending standards for residential mortgages evidenced in the most recent SLOOS was cited as a factor likely to support further progress.

Advance estimates for September indicated a narrower merchandise trade deficit, with a rebound in exports and a decline in imports relative to August. Participants generally viewed the housing sector as continuing to recover, although a couple of participants noted that the pace of recovery was slow.

For example, in the most recent projections, the median of FOMC participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment was 4.9 percent. Some noted that the demand for ON RRPs could be reduced by widening the spread between the interest rate on reserves and the offering rate on ON RRPs. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. The surprisingly limited extent to which aggregate data indicated upward pressure on wage growth also suggested some remaining slack in labor markets. They expressed a range of views about the likelihood that incoming information would make an adjustment appropriate at the time of their next meeting. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. The rates of private-sector hires and quits moved up in February, while the rate of job openings declined a little but was still at an elevated level. However, for many other participants, the recent developments provided greater confidence that inflation would rise to 2 percent over the medium term. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. Inflation continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. The expected path for the federal funds rate implied by quotes on overnight index swap rates steepened slightly, on net, over the intermeeting period. Likely in part because of the increase in mortgage rates, refinance originations decreased in November, but purchase originations were little changed. The near-term forecast for consumer price inflation was somewhat higher than in the previous projection, reflecting recent increases in energy prices. For example, in the most recent projections, the median of FOMC participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment was 4.8 percent. The rate of private-sector job openings was unchanged at a high level in December, while the rate of hiring edged up and the rate of quits edged down. Total industrial production declined in January, as unseasonably warm weather reduced the demand for heating, which held down the output of utilities. Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate residential mortgages moved lower over the intermeeting period, in line with comparable-maturity Treasury yields. For example, in the most recent projections, the median of FOMC participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment was 4.6 percent. Financial markets experienced a notable bout of volatility early in the intermeeting period; volatility was particularly pronounced in equity markets. In some Districts, reports from business contacts or evidence from surveys pointed to continuing shortages of workers in segments of the labor market. Real GDP growth, which slowed in the first quarter, was expected to pick up in the second quarter and to outpace potential output growth through 2020. Inflation pressures in the foreign economies generally remained subdued, even though higher oil prices put some upward pressure on headline inflation. In some cases, firms were coping with labor shortages by increasing salaries, benefits, or workplace amenities in order to attract and retain workers. With regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to remove the sentence indicating that \"the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.\" The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics in November were below their levels at the end of the previous economic expansion. Broad consumer credit grew at a solid pace through September, though October and November saw credit card growth at banks edge a bit lower on average. Participants commented on a number of risks associated with their outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation over the medium term. For example, in the most recent projections, the median of FOMC participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment was 4.4 percent. Financing conditions for businesses and households tightened a bit further over the intermeeting period but remained generally supportive of spending. Participants commented on a number of risks associated with their outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation over the medium term. The staff also noted that the sustained growth of lending by banks to nonbank financial firms represented an increase in financial interconnectedness. Moreover, the possibility of favorable outcomes of trade negotiations could be a factor that would provide a boost to economic activity in the future. Consumer credit expanded at a moderate pace in the second quarter overall, with bank credit data pointing to continued growth through July and August. Late in the period, equity prices retraced some of their gains, as concerns about the spread of the coronavirus weighed nagativeely on risk sentiment. A sharp reduction in global demand for petroleum had led to unused supply that was overwhelming storage capacity, resulting in a plunge in oil prices. In this way, these emergency lending facilities were intended to help support the economy until pandemic-related credit market disruptions had abated. Financial conditions had improved, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. While the S&P 500 index was little changed, the effect of renewed outbreaks was evident in the differentiated performance across S&P industry sectors. The consumer price index (CPI) increased 0.6 percent over the 12 months ending in June, while core CPI inflation was 1.2 percent over the same period. The consumer sentiment measures from both the Michigan survey and the Conference Board survey improved notably in June but fell back somewhat in July. The July SLOOS and other surveys of mortgage market conditions suggested that both bank and nonbank lenders tightened standards in the second quarter. The information available at the time of the September 15??6 meeting suggested that U.S. real GDP was rebounding at a rapid rate in the third quarter. However, the credit quality of municipal debt deteriorated somewhat, driven by a relatively large volume of credit rating downgrades of revenue bonds. Allthough business contacts indicated that overall business activity had been stronger than they expected, it remained well below pre-pandemic levels. Expectations for the economic conditions that will prevail when the FOMC first lifts the target range were little changed since the September surveys. Gross corporate bond issuance was fairly strong in November and December, and seasoned and initial public offerings in the equity markets were robust. With the economy still far from those goals, participants judged that it was likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. Construction permits for single-family homes moved down, on net, over January and February, pointing to some slowing in construction in coming months. There continued to be no participation in the Federal Reserve's repo operations, but participation in the Federal Reserve's ON RRP increased a little. These minor technical adjustments would have no implications for the effects of the Federal Reserve's asset purchases on overall financial conditions. Participants agreed that this technical adjustment had no bearing on the appropriate path for the federal funds rate or the stance of monetary policy. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market OperationsThe manager turned first to a discussion of financial market developments over the period. Participants observed that economic activity had continued to expand in recent months, though at a less rapid pace than in the first half of the year. In the residential mortgage market, financing conditions remained accommodative, particularly for borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria. As a result, the 12-month change in PCE prices was projected to move up further relative to September's pace and to end the year well above 2 percent. Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months, but the summer's rise in COVID-19 cases has slowed their recovery. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market OperationsThe manager turned first to a discussion of financial market developments over the period. Shortages of construction materials appeared to have hampered building completions, and there was limited availability of lots ready for construction. Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities. Even so, an improvement in supply conditions and a decline in consumer energy prices were expected to slow PCE price inflation to 2.6 percent in 2022. Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities. The staff noted that leverage at key nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) was elevated and that bank lending to NBFIs continued to increase notably. The manager noted that, if ON RRP usage continued to rise, it may be appropriate at some point to consider further lifting the per-counterparty limit. Gross nonfinancial corporate bond issuance slowed in May, especially among speculative-grade issuers, amid elevated market volatility and high yields. This development reversed a pattern of loan loss reserves being released throughout last year and reflected concerns about the credit quality outlook. The private-sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, declined further in May but remained at a high level. Credit appeared to be available to most small businesses, although the share of small firms reporting that it was difficult to obtain loans increased. As a result, while the projected level of real GDP remained above potential this year, the gap was expected to have closed by the second half of 2023. Staff Review of the Financial SituationOver the intermeeting period, U.S. Treasury yields and the market-implied federal funds rate path moved higher. In their discussion of current economic conditions, participants noted that recent indicators had pointed to modest growth in spending and production. Participants agreed that activity in the housing market had continued to weaken, largely reflecting the increase in mortgage rates over the past year. Measures of inflation compensation based on the difference between yields on nominal Treasury securities and inflation-indexed issues had edged higher. The unemployment rate ticked back down to 4.7 percent in August, but it remained within the narrow band that prevailed since the beginning of the year. In the household sector, debt expanded in the second quarter at a rate slightly below that in the first quarter, as mortgage debt decelerated somewhat. In the view of many participants, economic expansion would probably track close to the rate of growth of the economy's potential next year and in 2008. More generally, surveys of business conditions suggested that increases in business activity were somewhat slower in August than in the second quarter. Core consumer price inflation remained moderate in August and September and, on a twelve-month change basis, was down noticeably from a year earlier.   Early in the intermeeting period, the functioning of short-term funding markets improved somewhat, but conditions in these markets remained strained.   Nonetheless, the potential for significant further weakening in housing activity and home prices represented a downside risk to the economic outlook.   To provide means for meeting System and Treasury commitments in particular currencies, and to facilitate operations of the Exchange Stabilization Fund. Real disposable personal income was unchanged in the fourth quarter, held down by higher food and energy prices, and moved up only slightly in January. Headline consumer price inflation in the United States remained elevated in April and May, mostly because of large increases in food and energy prices. Headline consumer price inflation in the United States stepped up in recent months, largely as a result of sizable increases in food and energy prices. While some financial institutions had strengthened their balance sheets with new capital issues, raising new capital had become increasingly difficult. Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction, and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. In the business sector, investment in equipment and software fell in the second quarter, largely reflecting a sharp drop in spending on motor vehicles. The failure or near failure of a number of major financial institutions had deepened market concerns about counterparty credit risk and liquidity risk. Moreover, households, like businesses, were reportedly reacting to the shifting economic circumstances in recent weeks by cutting expenditures further. Gross issuance of bonds by nonfinancial investment-grade companies continued at a solid pace, but issuance of speculative-grade bonds remained at zero. To provide means for meeting System and Treasury commitments in particular currencies, and to facilitate operations of the Exchange Stabilization Fund. Output in high-tech sectors contracted in the fourth quarter, reflecting reduced production of semiconductors, communications equipment, and computers. After rising rapidly during the first nine months of the year, producer prices excluding food and energy fell sharply in the last three months of 2008. Yields and spreads on 30-day A1/P1 nonfinancial and financial CP as well as on asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) declined modestly and remained low. Several members felt that the significant deterioration in the economic outlook merited a very substantial increase in purchases of longer-term assets. Looking further ahead, participants considered a number of factors that would be likely to restrain the pace of economic recovery over the medium term. Ensuring that policy accommodation can ultimately be withdrawn smoothly and at the appropriate time would remain a top priority of the Federal Reserve. Real spending on equipment outside of high-tech and transportation seemed to have dropped less rapidly in the second quarter than in the first quarter. With the recovery projected to be rather sluggish, most participants anticipated that the employment situation was likely to be downbeat for some time. Median year-ahead inflation expectations in the Reuters/University of Michigan Survey of Consumers held relatively steady in July, as in recent months. Subsequently, investors revised down the expected policy path after the June employment report and the Chairman's semiannual monetary policy testimony. Large fractions of respondents to the July survey again noted that they had tightened standards and that the demand for CRE loans had weakened further. Core consumer price inflation continued to be subdued in July and August, but higher gasoline prices raised overall consumer price inflation in August. In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability. Conditions in the secondary market for leveraged syndicated loans continued to improve, as secondary-market prices rose and bid-asked spreads narrowed. In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability. To provide means for meeting System and Treasury commitments in particular currencies, and to facilitate operations of the Exchange Stabilization Fund. All agreed that raising the IOER rate and the target for the federal funds rate would be a key element of a move to less accommodative monetary policy. Participants recognized, however, that the supply of reserve balances would need to be reduced considerably to lift the funds rate above the IOER rate. Despite the strength of exports, merchandise trade balances declined for some countries where strong domestic demand caused imports to outpace exports. The latest readings on core inflation--which exclude the relatively volatile prices of food and energy--were generally lower than they had anticipated. With private final demand having strengthened, inventory adjustments and fiscal stimulus were no longer the main factors supporting economic expansion. However, inflation expectations were seen by most participants as well anchored, which would tend to curb any tendency for actual inflation to decline. However, investor demand for high-quality commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) reportedly was robust, although issuance of CMBS remained muted. Household spending is increasing gradually, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Meanwhile, nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding contracted as very low yields on corporate bonds led to some substitution toward longer-term debt. The pace of initial public offerings and seasoned equity offerings by nonfinancial firms slowed in August, partly reflecting typical seasonal patterns. In reaction, the yen depreciated about 3 percent against the dollar, essentially reversing its rise over the preceding part of the intermeeting period. Asset prices had been relatively sensitive to incoming economic data over the intermeeting period but generally ended the period little changed on net. Household spending is increasing gradually, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Household spending is increasing gradually, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Secondary-market prices for leveraged loans rose slightly over the intermeeting period, while bid-asked spreads in that market continued to drift down. To provide means for meeting System and Treasury commitments in particular currencies, and to facilitate operations of the Exchange Stabilization Fund. The increase in equity prices reflected the apparent firming of the economic recovery and favorable early reports on fourth-quarter corporate earnings. If so, a considerably stronger recovery could take hold, more in line with the sorts of recoveries seen following deep economic recessions in the past. Staff Review of the Financial SituationInvestors appeared to adopt a more cautious attitude toward risk, particularly later in the intermeeting period. Overall consumer price inflation was more moderate than earlier in the year, as prices of energy and some commodities declined from their recent peaks. To provide means for meeting System and Treasury commitments in particular currencies, and to facilitate operations of the Exchange Stabilization Fund. Private nonfarm employment continued to expand moderately, while state and local government employment decreased at a slower pace than earlier in 2011. But most firms reportedly remained fairly cautious--particularly on hiring decisions--and continued to be uncertain about the strength of the recovery. Imports edged down, on net, with higher purchases of services and petroleum products more than offset by declines in all of the other major categories. Bank credit continued to expand at a moderate rate in the third quarter, with further growth in loans augmented by larger gains in securities holdings. In the agricultural sector, farm incomes were high, notwithstanding the drought, although elevated grain prices were cutting into profits on livestock. To provide means for meeting System and Treasury commitments in particular currencies, and to facilitate operations of the Exchange Stabilization Fund. Increases in real personal consumption expenditures picked up somewhat in the fourth quarter, boosted importantly by higher spending on motor vehicles. House prices continued to rise in recent months, with national home price indexes up between 5 and 12 percent over the 12-month period ending in April. A few participants raised the possibility that recent declines in inflation might suggest that the economic recovery was not as strong as some thought. To provide means for meeting System and Treasury commitments in particular currencies, and to facilitate operations of the Exchange Stabilization Fund. One of these participants suggested that persistently low inflation was a clear reflection of a sizable shortfall of employment from its maximum level. Participants generally favored the further testing of various tools, including the TDF, to better assess their operational readiness and effectiveness. However, the labor force participation rate also declined in April and then held steady in May, while the employment-to-population ratio remained flat. Near-term inflation expectations from the Michigan survey were little changed, on net, in June and early July, while longer-term expectations declined. During participants' discussion of prospects for economic activity abroad, they commented on a number of uncertainties and risks attending the outlook. Over the intermeeting period, the foreign exchange value of the dollar had appreciated, particularly against the euro, the yen, and the pound sterling. Following large increases in July, both exports and imports grew only modestly, with gains concentrated in capital goods excluding automotive products. Foreign economies appeared to have continued to expand at a moderate rate in the third quarter, although with considerable divergence across countries. Option-implied volatility for one-month returns on the S&P 500 index--the VIX--rose sharply late in the period to levels close to those in mid-October. CRE loans on banks' books expanded at a moderate pace in October and November, and issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) was strong. To provide means for meeting System and Treasury commitments in particular currencies, and to facilitate operations of the Exchange Stabilization Fund. The deputy manager followed with a review of System open market operations conducted during the period since the Committee met on December 16-17, 2014. Looking ahead, some participants highlighted the potential benefits of streamlining the Committee's postmeeting statement once normalization has begun. In its medium-term and longer-run projections, the staff slightly lowered its assumptions for potential GDP growth and real equilibrium interest rates. Growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products appeared to remain relatively slow in the second quarter. Conditions in the market for residential mortgages continued to improve slowly, with interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages declining slightly. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained generally accommodative, and the performance of outstanding consumer loans was largely stable. Inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. The unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually and to run a little below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period. Participants noted that business fixed investment appeared to be increasing at a solid rate despite the sharp contraction in energy-related investment. They were concerned about a potential loss of momentum in the economy and the associated possibility that inflation might fail to increase as expected. Market-based measures of inflation compensation moved slightly lower; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. The measures from both the Survey of Professional Forecasters for the fourth quarter and the Survey of Primary Dealers in December moved down slightly. The unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually and to run somewhat below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.\" To provide means for meeting System and Treasury commitments in particular currencies, and to facilitate operations of the Exchange Stabilization Fund. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.\" Firms' nominal spending for nonresidential structures excluding drilling and mining increased somewhat in January after having declined for two months. The possible adverse effects on investment spending of concerns about global growth and the associated volatility in financial markets were also noted. A number of participants judged that the headwinds restraining growth and holding down the neutral rate of interest were likely to subside only slowly.

Decreases in equity indexes in the AFEs, particularly in Europe, also reportedly reflected concerns about the possibility of a successful \"leave\" vote. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.\" Prices of risky assets and advanced-economy bond yields also fell in response to the heightened uncertainty and expectations of slower economic growth.

Building permit issuance for new single-family homes--which tends to be a reliable indicator of the underlying trend in construction--advanced solidly. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.\" Over the intermeeting period, federal funds continued to trade near the center of the Committee's 1/2 to 3/4 percent target range except on month-ends.

This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.\" Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded further in April and May, and the average pace of job gains over the first five months of the year was solid. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Spreads of yields on investment- and speculative-grade nonfinancial corporate bonds over comparable-maturity Treasury securities narrowed a bit on net. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. The available trade data suggested that the change in real net exports would make a neutral contribution to real U.S. GDP growth in the fourth quarter. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had declined this year and were running below 2 percent. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have declined this year and are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Lower oil prices, weaker-than-expected economic data, and uncertainty over U.S. trade policy likely contributed to the weakness in the Canadian dollar. Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to move up in coming months and to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term. In contrast, starts of multifamily units moved up in March after contracting in February, and they were higher in the first quarter than in the fourth. In this context, a few participants emphasized the need to build additional resilience in the financial sector at this point in the economic expansion. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Real business expenditures for nonresidential structures declined in the third quarter both for the drilling and mining sector and outside that sector. Contacts in a couple of Districts indicated that labor shortages, particularly for skilled labor, might be constraining activity in certain industries. Several participants, however, expressed concern that a slowing of redemptions could be misinterpreted as a signal about the stance of monetary policy. Participants considered it important to present information on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to the public in ways that communicated these facts. In offshore funding markets, the one-month foreign exchange swap basis for most major currencies increased, consistent with typical year-end pressures. The Committee continues to view changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. In U.S. risky asset markets, the S&P 500 equity index was down as much as 8 percent at one point during the period but ended the period notably higher. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to show signs of deterioration, although actual corporate bond defaults remained low overall. This interpretation was seen as consistent with the behavior of the most recent survey-based measures of expected inflation, which were little changed. Overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy, both measured on a 12-month basis, had declined and were running below 2 percent. Issuance of agency and non-agency CMBS was solid in May, and CRE lending by banks expanded in April and May at a slower rate than in the first quarter. Equity price increases were broad based across major sectors, with technology, financial, and communication services firms outperforming broad indexes. Several participants observed that valuations in equity and corporate bond markets were near all-time highs and that CRE valuations were also elevated. Foreign inflation rose in the second quarter, pushed up by earlier increases in oil prices as well as by rising food prices in some emerging economies. A few participants observed that it would be important to be vigilant in monitoring incoming data for any sign of softening in labor market conditions. These participants offered various perspectives on the relationship between financial stability and policies that keep interest rates persistently low. By unanimous vote, the Committee amended its Program for Security of FOMC Information (Program) with three sets of changes, effective February 1, 2020. CRE loan growth at banks remained solid through February and CRE debt outstanding increased modestly through mid-February, according to available data. Members indicated that they would continue to closely monitor market conditions and that the Committee was prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate. In corporate credit markets, concerns about potential defaults were rising, and ratings agencies had put on nagativee watch or downgraded many issuers. Inflation compensation fell sharply in the first half of March but subsequently recovered, as overall financial conditions and TIPS liquidity improved. Financial conditions have improved, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. In addition, the inflation forecast for the rest of the year was revised up slightly, as some recent consumer goods prices were stronger than expected. Bank contacts reported ample capacity to lend to creditworthy borrowers; however, surveys of credit availability indicated that bank lending was tight. On net, most foreign equity indexes declined, option-implied volatility in the euro area increased a bit, and most AFE long-term sovereign yields fell. Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose strongly in October, and new orders for these capital goods continued to advance. In contrast, money market funds and open-ended mutual funds were characterized by significant vulnerabilities associated with liquidity transformation. However, in contrast to recent months, most of the recent increase in longer-term Treasury yields was accounted for by higher TIPS-implied real yields. Based on reports from business contacts, some participants noted that the step-up in demand for labor had started to put some upward pressure on wages. The situation was quite different in some emerging market economies (EMEs) whose low vaccination rates left them vulnerable to new waves of infections. These participants pointed out that there was no evidence of broad-based price pressures or of inappropriately high longer-term inflation expectations. Nevertheless, market participants emphasized that, even with these procedures, a delayed payment would create severe and broad-based market disruption. Participants noted that their District contacts generally did not expect these bottlenecks to be fully resolved until sometime next year or even later. In their discussion of current economic conditions, participants noted that indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen. In the April SLOOS, large banks reported unchanged standards on C&I loans to small firms, while small banks tightened standards modestly to such firms. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. Most market participants appeared to view a moderation of inflation and slower, but still positivee, economic growth ahead as the most likely scenario. In addition, the staff assessed that business leverage was high, but businesses maintained ample cash on hand and their credit quality remained strong. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. Outflows from funds dedicated to emerging markets continued at a modest pace, and credit spreads in emerging market economies narrowed somewhat on net.

Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. The resumption of commercial aircraft production boosted manufacturing output and more than offset a fall in the production of motor vehicles and parts. Real spending on nonresidential construction improved materially in the third quarter, boosted by substantial gains in drilling and mining expenditures. Foreign industrialized economies expanded robustly in the third quarter, and available indicators for the fourth quarter appeared promising, on balance. At its November meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase the target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4 percent. Consumer sentiment measured by surveys moved up in December and, judging by the preliminary reading of the Michigan Survey, edged up further in January. In some areas, home price appreciation reportedly had slowed noticeably, highlighting the risks to aggregate demand of a pullback in the housing sector. Some participants cited stronger growth abroad and robust nonresidential investment spending as potentially contributing more to activity than expected. Industrial production in March expanded at about the same strong pace as it did in February, with gains posted across all major components of the index. The Committee also discussed briefly the schedule for FOMC meetings next year and tentatively agreed to increase the number of two-day meetings to four. The output of motor vehicles and parts fell in September, as automakers continued to trim production of light trucks in response to bloated inventories. The U.S. international trade deficit widened to another record in August, reflecting a surge in imports that more than offset a sizable jump in exports. Nonetheless, nearly all participants viewed the current rates of core inflation as uncomfortably high and stressed the importance of further moderation. In the days after the August FOMC meeting, financial market participants appeared to become more concerned about liquidity and counterparty credit risk. In South America, activity was strong, boosted by high prices for commodities and, in Argentina and Venezuela, by expansionary macroeconomic policies.   In Canada and the United Kingdom, output growth moderated but remained robust, as vigorous domestic demand was partly offset by rapid growth of imports. The recently enacted fiscal stimulus package was expected to boost real GDP in the second half of 2008, but that effect was projected to unwind in 2009. The unemployment rate rose to 5.1 percent in March, significantly above its level a year ago, and the labor force participation rate was little changed. Available data for Canada indicated a continued substantial drag from exports in the first quarter, although domestic demand appeared relatively robust. Against this backdrop, term spreads in interbank funding markets and spreads on commercial paper issued by financial institutions widened significantly. Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction, and elevated energy prices were likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. With credit conditions generally tight and economic prospects relatively uncertain, investment spending was likely to be on the soft side going forward. Industrial production fell in September, although much of the drop was related to effects of recent hurricanes and a strike at an aircraft manufacturer. Subsequently, however, market expectations reversed in response to the heightened financial turmoil and to generally weaker-than-expected economic data. In the forecast prepared for the meeting, the staff lowered its projection for economic activity in the second half of 2008 as well as in 2009 and 2010. It was likely that, during the period of financial turmoil, the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet would need to be maintained at a high level. Yields and spreads on corporate bonds decreased noticeably, particularly for speculative-grade firms, but spreads remained high by historical standards. Debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors expanded at a somewhat faster pace in the fourth quarter of 2008 than in the first three quarters of the year. However, other participants anticipated that TALF loans would increase over time as financial market institutions became more familiar with the program. Spreads of yields on both BBB-rated and speculative-grade bonds relative to those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities were little changed on net. In the household survey, the unemployment rate edged down in July to 9.4 percent, while the labor force participation rate fell back to its March level. Industrial production, while remaining well below pre-crisis levels, moved up strongly in Japan and edged up in the euro area and in the United Kingdom. Although single-family starts were about flat in September, the number of starts was well above the record low reached in the first quarter of the year. Spreads on A2/P2-rated commercial paper (CP) and AA-rated asset-backed CP remained at the lower ends of their respective ranges over the past two years. Commercial construction continued to trend down, primarily reflecting weak fundamentals, though financing constraints probably were also playing a role. The staff discussed the potential portfolio paths and macroeconomic consequences of a number of different strategies for accomplishing these objectives. The Manager noted that a coupon swap is a common transaction in the market for MBS in which the two counterparties exchange securities at market prices. Even so, spreads of high-grade unsecured financial commercial paper to nonfinancial commercial paper widened only modestly over the intermeeting period. In addition, they saw inflation as likely to stabilize near recent low readings in coming quarters and then gradually rise toward more desirable levels. Real business spending on equipment and software rose strongly again in the second quarter, with increases widespread across the categories of spending. Standards for commercial real estate loans and residential mortgages remained very tight, and banks did not appear to be easing standards on such loans. Participants agreed that factors like these were pushing the unemployment rate up, but they differed in their assessments of the extent of such effects. In February, nominal retail sales, excluding purchases of motor vehicles and parts, rose moderately; sales of light motor vehicles posted a robust gain. Activity in the housing market remained very weak, as the large overhang of foreclosed and distressed properties continued to restrain new construction. This outlook was based partly on a projected leveling-off of commodity prices and the belief that longer-run inflation expectations would remain stable. Real nonfarm inventory investment rose moderately in the first quarter, but data for April suggested that the pace of inventory accumulation had slowed. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the transactions by the Open Market Desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York over the intermeeting period. Some policymakers noted that their outlooks for economic activity were shaped in part by an expectation of fiscal restraint at all levels of government. Although starts and permits for new single-family homes edged up in September, they stayed near the depressed levels seen since the middle of last year. However, participants indicated that many details of the new plan had not yet been worked out and that a number of important issues remained unresolved. Starts and permits for new single-family homes rose in November and December but remained only a little above the depressed levels seen earlier in 2011. Data on credit card solicitations and from responses to the January SLOOS suggested that lending standards on consumer loans continued to ease modestly. Participants noted that the ECB's three-year refinancing operation had apparently contributed to improved conditions in European sovereign debt markets. Inventories in most industries looked to be reasonably well aligned with sales in recent months, although stocks of motor vehicles continued to be lean. Dollar funding pressures continued to diminish, and the implied cost of dollar funding through the foreign exchange swap market fell moderately further. Contacts in some parts of the country said that highly qualified workers were in short supply; overall, however, wage pressures had been limited so far. Yields on most euro-area peripheral countries' sovereign debt rose, particularly after the May 6 elections in Greece failed to produce a new government. Reserves increased over the intermeeting period, in part because of the settlement of the ongoing MBS purchases announced at the September FOMC meeting. Most participants saw the risks to the inflation outlook as broadly balanced, and many noted that longer-term inflation expectations were well anchored. Household spending had continued to advance and the housing sector had shown further signs of improvement, but growth in the business sector had slowed. Such a dynamic was seen as potentially leading to a virtuous cycle that could help support household spending and financial market conditions over time. Yields on corporate bonds fell roughly in line with those on Treasury securities of comparable maturity, generally leaving their spreads little changed. Total consumer price inflation picked up in recent months but continued to be modest, and measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable. Furthermore, a secular decline in labor market dynamism, or turnover, might have contributed to a reduction in the size of normal monthly payroll gains. Nevertheless, a number of participants noted that such operations were worthy of further study or saw them as potentially helpful in some circumstances. Members generally continued to see the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished, on net, since last fall. The pace of activity in the housing sector appeared to continue to slow somewhat, likely reflecting the higher level of mortgage rates since the spring. The staff did not see the uncertainty around its outlook for inflation as unusually high, and the risks to that outlook were viewed as broadly balanced. These documents were modified to incorporate the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements authorized by a resolution on October 29, 2013. Total payroll employment increased in December, but at a slower pace than in previous months, and the unemployment rate declined but was still elevated. Consumer price inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, but measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable. Consumer price inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, but measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable. Participants requested additional analysis from the staff on issues related to normalization as background for further discussion at their next meeting. Intermeeting data releases on euro-area industrial production came in below market expectations, also weighing on headline equity markets in the region. Both the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons and the rate of long-duration unemployment declined a little over the past two months. The decrease in the value of imports stemmed in large part from a reduction in the value of petroleum imports, reflecting both lower prices and volumes. Participants discussed how recent developments influenced their expectations for reaching the FOMC's 2 percent inflation objective over the medium term. Delinquency rates on credit card loans and auto loans stayed low through the second quarter, while delinquency rates on student loans remained elevated. Several participants, however, cited downside risks to inflation, pointing, for example, to declines in market-based measures of inflation compensation. They indicated that they would be assessing a range of labor market indicators over the period ahead to confirm further improvement in the labor market. The deputy manager also discussed plans to publish additional information on details of the Committee's current Treasury securities reinvestment policy. The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons was flat, on balance, in recent months after declining considerably over the previous year. The October FOMC statement and the stronger-than-expected October employment report, in particular, boosted expectations of FOMC action at this meeting. Early in the intermeeting period, concerns among investors about the global economic outlook appeared to trigger a sharp reduction in their risk-taking. This accommodative stance of monetary policy was expected to support further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. Participants generally agreed that the Committee should continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. However, some areas that were affected by the slowdown in the energy sector experienced house price declines or increases in mortgage delinquency rates. Participants generally agreed that the Committee should continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. The Subcommittee, in consultation with the Committee, may provide additional instructions to the Selected Bank regarding holdings of foreign currencies. Inflation in the EMEs also moved up, driven largely by a rebound in Chinese food prices and, in some countries, by the effects of currency depreciation. The Subcommittee, in consultation with the Committee, may provide additional instructions to the Selected Bank regarding holdings of foreign currencies. Participants generally agreed that the Committee should continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. The rise in CMBS delinquency rates was mostly confined to loans that were originated during the period of weak underwriting before the financial crisis. Inflation was still expected to be somewhat higher this year than last year, largely reflecting an upturn in the prices for food and non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had changed little on balance. The median of inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years from the Michigan survey edged up both in June and in the preliminary reading for July. However, payrolls for state and local governments declined in July and August, and nominal construction spending by these governments decreased in July. The Canadian dollar appreciated following a rate hike by the Bank of Canada at its September meeting that came sooner than market participants expected. It was also noted that the persistence of low inflation might result in the federal funds rate staying uncomfortably close to its effective lower bound. On balance, participants continued to forecast that PCE price inflation would stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term. Total PCE price inflation was projected to pick up in 2018, as most of the softness in core PCE price inflation this year was expected to be transitory. Many indicated that they expected cyclical pressures associated with a tightening labor market to show through to higher inflation over the medium term. The Subcommittee, in consultation with the Committee, may provide additional instructions to the Selected Bank regarding holdings of foreign currencies. Business contacts in a few Districts reported that uncertainty regarding trade policy had led to some reductions or delays in their investment spending. Some also expressed interest in studying, over the longer term, approaches in which the Committee would target a mixture of secured and unsecured rates. Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index at the one-month horizon--the VIX--increased, though it remained below the levels seen in early February. Conditions in the consumer asset-backed securities market remained stable over the intermeeting period with slightly higher spreads and robust issuance. A few participants expressed concern that longer-run inflation expectations would remain low, particularly if economic growth slowed more than expected. In general, participants agreed that risks to the outlook appeared roughly balanced, although some noted that downside risks may have increased of late. The Subcommittee, in consultation with the Committee, may provide additional instructions to the Selected Bank regarding holdings of foreign currencies. Such an announcement would provide more certainty about the process for completing the normalization of the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. Market participants reported seeing slightly more pass-through from repo rates to the federal funds rate on days with heightened firmness in repo rates. Manufacturing production had declined so far this year, dragged down in part by weak real exports, the ongoing global slowdown, and trade uncertainties. All told, the data on construction and sales continued to suggest that the decline in mortgage rates since late 2018 has been boosting housing activity. Imports fell much more, and the declines were broad based, with the largest contributions coming from imports of consumer goods and automotive products. Various participants remarked on issues related to the implementation of monetary policy, highlighting topics for further discussion at future meetings. The Subcommittee, in consultation with the Committee, may provide additional instructions to the Selected Bank regarding holdings of foreign currencies. Issuance of speculative-grade bonds over the intermeeting period remained about in line with the average pace over December and January in recent years. The U.S. dollar appreciated notably against most currencies, with the exception of other safe-haven currencies, and crude oil prices dropped 40 percent. Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in January and February, and the unemployment rate was at its 50-year low of 3.5 percent in February. Participants expressed their deep concern for those whose health had been harmed and observed that the matter was, above all, a public health emergency. Broad stock price index increases over the intermeeting period were led by the energy, consumer discretionary, basic materials, and health-care sectors. Labor market conditions improved in May, but these improvements were modest relative to the substantial deterioration seen over the previous two months. The consumer price index (CPI) increased 1.3 percent over the 12 months ending in August, while core CPI inflation was 1.7 percent over the same period. State and local government payrolls expanded in July and August, although nominal state and local construction expenditures decreased in June and July. Some contacts reported difficulties in managing disruptions in supply chains as well as elevated levels of employee absenteeism because of the pandemic. Nevertheless, inflation remained subdued, and participants still generally judged that the overall effect of the pandemic on prices was disinflationary. Spreads on commercial paper (CP) and negotiable certificates of deposit across different tenors were little changed and remained at pre-pandemic levels. The Subcommittee, in consultation with the Committee, may provide additional instructions to the Selected Bank regarding holdings of foreign currencies. They saw progress on vaccinations as essential for supporting further gains in aggregate consumer spending and for the economic recovery more generally. Conduct repurchase agreement operations to support effective policy implementation and the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets. These measures are likely to have been less affected by changes in workforce composition, and they were rising more slowly than their pre-pandemic pace. Staff Economic OutlookThe U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the March FOMC meeting was considerably stronger than the January forecast. In addition, inflation was forecast to be temporarily boosted this year by the expected emergence of some production bottlenecks and supply constraints. Conduct repurchase agreement operations to support effective policy implementation and the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets. The labor force participation rate and employment-to-population ratio increased in March, though both measures remained below their pre-pandemic levels. Conduct repurchase agreement operations to support effective policy implementation and the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets. The staff's near-term outlook for inflation was revised up markedly, but the staff continued to expect the rise in inflation this year to be transitory. Conduct repurchase agreement operations to support effective policy implementation and the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets. The monthly pace of job gains had picked up, with employment expanding 850,000 in June and with notable increases in the leisure and hospitality sector. Although real PCE declined in July, the components of retail sales used to estimate PCE rose strongly in August, returning to levels seen in the spring. On balance, major foreign equity indexes were mixed, the broad dollar appreciated a touch, and sovereign yields in most major AFEs increased moderately. As a result, the 12-month change in PCE prices was projected to hold roughly steady over the remainder of 2021 and to end the year well above 2 percent. Various participants stressed that economic conditions were likely to justify keeping the rate at or near its lower bound over the next couple of years. Issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) remained robust, supported by spreads of agency CMBS generally at or below pre-pandemic levels. Many participants judged that the appropriate pace of balance sheet runoff would likely be faster than it was during the previous normalization episode. The Subcommittee, in consultation with the Committee, may provide additional instructions to the Selected Bank regarding holdings of foreign currencies. They further anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be warranted to achieve the Committee's objectives. They also noted that a restrictive stance of policy may well become appropriate depending on the evolving economic outlook and the risks to the outlook. Members agreed that the invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were likely to weigh on economic activity. Participants noted that the imbalance between supply and demand across a wide range of product markets was contributing to upward pressure on inflation. Members agreed that the invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. Participants judged that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. In addition, although nominal wage growth remained strong according to a wide range of measures, there were some signs of a leveling off or edging down. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Participants judged that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Delinquencies for Federal Housing Administration mortgages increased slightly, but overall mortgage delinquency rates were still near pre-pandemic lows. While real GDP growth had rebounded in the second half of 2022, several participants noted that growth in PDFP had nearly stalled in the fourth quarter. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. Business investment in real nonfarm inventories increased moderately in the fourth quarter, boosted by a rapid accumulation of motor vehicle inventories. At its December meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase the target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4 percent. However, members also recognized that in current circumstances, checking upside risks to inflation was important to sustaining good economic performance. Also by unanimous vote, the Committee established a FOIA Requester Service Center and designated Carol R. Low to fulfill the associated responsibilities. Sales of new homes also moved up in March, but their average in the first quarter was down substantially from the peak in the third quarter of last year. Also, the considerably lower level of energy prices of recent weeks, if sustained, would help reduce overall inflation and damp increases in core prices. Participants continued to expect the economy to expand at a rate close to or a little below the economy's long-run sustainable pace over coming quarters. The access of investment-grade corporate borrowers to credit so far remained unimpeded, and rates on investment-grade bonds had declined in recent weeks. Two-year Treasury yields declined roughly in line with the lower expected policy path, while yields on ten-year Treasuries were little changed, on net.   New home sales dropped in November and December after having held relatively steady since August, keeping inventories of unsold homes at elevated levels. On balance, expectations seemed to remain fairly well anchored, but participants agreed that continued stability of inflation expectations was essential. Although employment by firms in the nonbusiness services sector and in state and local governments continued to rise, declines elsewhere were widespread. Recent readings on core inflation had improved somewhat, although participants noted that some of that improvement probably reflected transitory factors. Real spending on nonresidential construction continued to rise in the first quarter, but at a substantially slower rate than over the previous two years. Core consumer price inflation remained relatively stable, while headline inflation was elevated as a result of large increases in food and energy prices. The U.S. international trade deficit widened in July, as a surge in the value of imports of goods and services more than offset strong growth in exports. The payment of interest on excess reserve balances was intended to assist in maintaining the federal funds rate close to the target set by the Committee. In the euro area and the United Kingdom, purchasing managers indexes fell in November to levels associated with severe contractions in economic activity. Industrial production, trade, and measures of consumer sentiment registered declines across many other countries in both emerging Asia and Latin America. Over the intermeeting period, investors marked down their expectations for the path of the federal funds rate, as measured by money market futures rates. Consumer price inflation was fairly quiescent in recent months, although the upturn in energy prices appeared likely to boost headline inflation in June. Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but are making progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Household spending appears to be expanding but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. The labor force participation rate, however, had declined steeply since the spring, likely reflecting, at least in part, adverse labor market conditions. Some participants saw advantages to varying the FOMC's holdings of longer-term assets system-atically in response to economic and financial developments. Increased exports of industrial supplies, capital goods, and automotive products were partly offset by declines in agricultural goods and consumer goods. The Manager also discussed plans to publish a new set of criteria that would allow a broader set of money market funds to become eligible counterparties. Reports on planned capital expenditures by small businesses showed some signs of improvement in recent months, although they remained relatively subdued. On the upside, the recent strength in household spending raised the possibility that domestic final demand could snap back more rapidly than anticipated. In the euro area, monthly indicators of activity, such as retail sales and purchasing managers indexes, were generally positivee in January and February. In contrast to headline inflation, core inflation and other measures of underlying inflation remained subdued, though they appeared to have bottomed out. Similarly, measures of underlying inflation continued to be somewhat low relative to levels seen as consistent with the dual mandate over the longer run. The Committee will monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will act as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability.\" Motor vehicle purchases declined during the spring when the availability of some models was limited, but rebounded somewhat in July as supplies improved. However, some strains emerged late in the intermeeting period in the market for repurchase agreements backed by lower-quality, nontraditional collateral. The revisions reflected discussion of an earlier draft during the Committee's December meeting as well as comments received over the intermeeting period. Recent indicators suggested some improvement in foreign economic activity early this year after a significant slowing in the fourth quarter of last year. Several members noted that the downward pressure on longer-term rates from continuing the Committee's maturity extension program was likely to be modest. Manufacturing production increased at a faster pace in July than in the second quarter, and the rate of manufacturing capacity utilization rose slightly. Across export categories, exports of industrial supplies posted a particularly large decline, as the volume of petroleum product exports dropped sharply. Option-implied volatility for the S&P 500 index fell noticeably following the September FOMC meeting but increased, on net, over the intermeeting period. By various estimates, underlying inflation trends remained subdued, and indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were generally viewed as stable. The staff saw the uncertainty around its projection for inflation as about average, and it viewed the risks to the inflation outlook as roughly balanced. After faster gains in January and February, private nonfarm employment increased at a subdued rate in March, and government employment declined slightly. In the April SLOOS, relatively large net fractions of these banks reported having eased standards and reduced spreads on C&I loans to firms of all sizes. However, the CRE sector showed some signs of recovery, and survey results indicated that the terms of CRE lending were easing and loan demand increasing. Participants noted that consumer spending continued to increase at a moderate rate in recent months despite tax increases and only modest gains in wages. Drawings on the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap lines will be approved by the Chairman in consultation with the Foreign Currency Subcommittee. In the agricultural sector, crop yields were healthy, farmland values were up, and lower crop prices were increasing the affordability of livestock feed. Uncertainty about future fiscal policy and the regulatory environment, including changes in health care, were mentioned as weighing on business planning. Measures of firms' hiring plans remained higher than a year earlier, and household expectations of the labor market situation improved in early December. Another participant favored introducing new quantitative thresholds of 5-1/2 percent for the unemployment rate and 2-1/4 percent for projected inflation. However, the medium-term projection for inflation was revised down slightly, reflecting a reassessment by the staff of the underlying trend in inflation. Several others, however, remained concerned that persistent low inflation in Europe and Japan could eventually erode inflation expectations more broadly. Even so, several participants pointed out that both long- and short-term unemployment and measures that include marginally attached workers had declined. The unemployment rate declined to 6.1 percent in June, the labor force participation rate was unchanged, and the employment-to-population ratio edged up. Household spending appeared to be rising moderately, and business fixed investment was advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow. Several participants added that slower economic growth in China or Japan or unanticipated events in the Middle East or Ukraine might pose a similar risk. Household spending appeared to be rising moderately, and business fixed investment was advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow. It would also note that, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range would likely occur later than currently anticipated. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined somewhat; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. The deputy manager also discussed the outcomes of recent tests of term and overnight reverse repurchase agreements (term RRPs and ON RRPs, respectively). In addition, valuation pressures appear to be building in the CRE sector, as indicated by rising prices and the easing in lending standards on CRE loans. However, several participants pointed out that the 3-month change in that index had firmed recently, signaling some improvement in the inflation outlook. Although they expressed some uncertainty about the extent of the likely near-term pickup, members expected moderate economic growth over the medium term. The deputy manager also updated the Committee on plans for tests of the Term Deposit Facility in August and of term RRPs at the end of the third quarter. However, a couple of participants noted that they did not expect this sector to be a major contributor to economic growth over the remainder of the year. Moreover, some members continued to see downside risks to inflation from the possibility of further dollar appreciation and declines in commodity prices. Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft edged down in October, although new orders for these capital goods continued to move up. Recent indicators for economic activity in China were relatively favorable, and several other emerging Asian economies strengthened in the third quarter. A staff presentation at this meeting reviewed broad strategies for reintroducing an aggregate cap on ON RRP operations and managing the cap subsequently. Many viewed labor market underutilization as having been substantially reduced over the past year, and a few saw slack as having been largely eliminated. Both readings on core inflation were boosted, in part, by movements in prices for some categories of goods and services whose prices tend to be volatile. They saw a risk that a more persistent slowdown in economic growth might be under way, which could hinder further improvement in labor market conditions. In addition, the recent depreciation of the dollar and indications of a rebound of economic growth in China appeared to reduce pressures on the renminbi. However, recent readings from national and regional surveys of business conditions suggested some pickup in business equipment spending in the near term. Participants' reports on the manufacturing sector indicated varying conditions across Districts, but, on the whole, manufacturing activity remained flat. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a solid pace in October and November, and the unemployment rate declined, reaching 4.6 percent in November. Both manufacturing production and mining output increased, but the output of utilities declined markedly because of unseasonably warm weather in October. Currency weakness prompted some EME central banks, such as the Bank of Mexico and the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, to tighten monetary policy. Regarding the household sector, the available information indicated that consumer spending had been rising at a moderate rate, on balance, since midyear. However, the volumes of CMBS issuance and of deals in the pipeline were lower in the first two months of the year than in each of the previous two years. In view of the substantial uncertainty, about half of the participants did not incorporate explicit assumptions about fiscal policy in their projections. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance. Gross issuance of corporate bonds stepped down in June from a strong pace in May, while issuance of institutional leveraged loans continued to be robust. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance. Despite generally better-than-expected earnings releases, AFE equity prices were mixed over the period, with bank stocks underperforming broader indexes. Issuance of asset-backed securities remained robust over the year to date and outpaced that of the previous year, providing support for consumer lending. However, standards and terms on auto and credit card loans were tighter for subprime borrowers, likely in response to rising delinquencies on such loans. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance. Consequently, participants generally expected that any reaction in financial markets to the start of balance sheet normalization would likely be limited. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance. In that regard, a number of participants noted the importance of continuing to emphasize that the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective is symmetric. Inflation on a 12-month basis was expected to move up in coming months and to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.혻 Although some signs of deterioration emerged over the intermeeting period, the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to be solid overall. These rates could also be targeted with abundant excess reserves, as could interest rates on secured funding or a mixture of secured and unsecured rates. The pace of gross equity issuance through both seasoned and initial offerings moderated, consistent with the weakness and volatility in the stock market. The unemployment rate was projected to decline a little further below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate and to bottom out in late 2020. The market-implied probability for a 25 basis point cut in the target range for the federal funds rate by the July FOMC meeting rose to about 85 percent. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained solid, as the volume of nonfinancial corporate bond upgrades outpaced that of downgrades in May. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market OperationsThe manager pro tem discussed developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period. Federal defense spending over July and August decelerated, and federal hiring of temporary workers for next year's decennial census was modest in August. Additionally, banks reported that their standards on auto loans and their willingness to make consumer installment loans were about unchanged on balance. Consumer asset-backed securities issuance was strong through October as spreads stabilized at levels that were somewhat above their post-crisis averages. Despite this improvement in risk sentiment, market participants expected weak overall growth in 2020, and elevated uncertainties in the outlook remained. Importantly, with conditions in MBS markets continuing to stabilize, primary mortgage rates fell to historically low levels over the intermeeting period. In June, the components of retail sales used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to estimate PCE, along with light motor vehicle sales, increased further. Residential real estate loans on banks' balance sheets declined, and the October SLOOS suggested that lending standards tightened for all mortgage types. The FOMC's updated guidance around asset purchases was seen as broadly in line with expectations and did not elicit noticeable financial market reaction. A couple of participants commented that it would be important for the appropriate regulatory bodies to address these financial stability vulnerabilities. Spreads on commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit across different tenors were little changed and remained near historically low levels. Mortgage rates for most borrowers increased but stayed near historically low levels, supporting elevated refinance and purchase activity through January. Several participants suggested that the ARP could hasten the recovery, which could help limit longer-term damage in labor markets caused by the pandemic. After the transitory effects of these factors fade, however, participants generally anticipated that annual inflation readings would edge down next year. However, a new surge in infections in several countries in Latin America and South Asia, notably India, underscored the fragility of the global recovery. Consumer loans grew at a robust pace in February, reflecting the continued expansion of auto loans and a partial rebound in credit card account balances. Progress on vaccinations will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy, but risks to the economic outlook remain. In questions and comments following the manager's briefing, participants expressed broad support for the establishment of the SRF and FIMA Repo Facility. The Open Market Desk at the Selected Bank will also report at least annually to the Committee on facility usage and the list of approved account holders. Furthermore, the spread of mortgage rates to MBS yields was close to pre-pandemic levels after having widened significantly at the start of the pandemic. For the year as a whole, therefore, real GDP was projected to post a substantial increase, with a correspondingly large decline in the unemployment rate. Progress on vaccinations will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy, but risks to the economic outlook remain. Progress on vaccinations will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy, but risks to the economic outlook remain. Participants observed that households had strong balance sheets and that consumer spending would also be supported by accommodative financial conditions. The Open Market Desk at the Selected Bank will also report at least annually to the Committee on facility usage and the list of approved account holders. Household credit quality remained strong, and delinquency rates across both prime and nonprime borrowers continued to be subdued by historical standards. These advances and the further tightening of labor market conditions were judged consistent with significant underlying momentum in the domestic economy. Inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. In addition, business survey data and information received from contacts indicated that manufacturing orders and production had fallen in some Districts. If this risk materialized, it would complicate the task of returning inflation to 2 percent and could raise substantially the economic costs of doing so. Available spending indicators, including the August retail sales report, suggested that real PCE was on track to post a modest gain in the third quarter. The U.S. dollar appreciated further against most major currencies, reaching multi-decade highs against the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen. Inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. With regard to the economic outlook, participants noted that recent data pointed to modest growth in economic activity over the second half of this year. \"The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.:\"Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production. Residential investment dropped further, however, and business fixed investment growth was held back by a decline in nonresidential structures investment. Inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. \"The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.:\"Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production. Credit continued to be generally available to businesses and households, but high borrowing costs appeared to weigh on financing volumes in many markets. Inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. \"The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.:\"Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production. The staff assessed that valuation pressures had eased for corporate bonds and leveraged loans, as spreads in both markets had increased from recent lows. \"The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.:\"Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production. Headline consumer inflation had been held down by falling consumer energy prices; more recently, however, crude oil prices climbed back up to high levels. Labor demand expanded further in the fourth quarter, as private nonfarm payrolls showed large gains in November followed by more-modest gains in December. For instance, the effects of a leveling out of housing wealth on the saving rate were difficult to predict, but, in the view of some, potentially sizable. Labor demand continued to increase in the first two months of 2006, as private nonfarm payroll employment showed large gains in both January and February. Excluding motor vehicles, consumption spending was robust, supported by continuing improvement in the labor market and advances in wage and salary income. Growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt appeared to have moderated only a bit in the first quarter from its robust pace in the fourth quarter of 2005. While liquid deposits expanded moderately, small time deposits and retail money funds advanced strongly, supported by further increases in offering rates. Some participants indicated that nonresidential construction was in the process of picking up and commercial vacancy rates were declining in some regions. If economic growth continued to moderate over coming quarters, as anticipated, pressures on productive resources would most likely continue to be limited. Given the risks to growth and inflation, Committee members were uncertain about how much, if any, further tightening would be needed after today's action. In general, inventories appeared to be well aligned with demand, and business surveys suggested that firms were comfortable with the level of inventories. Expansion of economic activity in the foreign industrial countries was solid in the first quarter, but indications for the second quarter were more mixed. Still, possible increases in resource utilization and the elevated prices of energy and other commodities had the potential to add to inflation pressures. Most forward-looking indicators of housing demand, including an index of pending home sales, pointed to a further deterioration in sales in the near term. Although these developments would likely be consistent with longer-term financial stability, they were likely to exert some restraint on aggregate demand. The stance of monetary policy appeared still to be somewhat restrictive, partly because of the effects of tighter credit conditions on aggregate demand.   In this context, the Committee judged that some inflation risks remained and indicated that it would continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. While liquid deposits continued to grow slowly, heightened demand for safety and liquidity appeared to boost holdings of retail money market mutual funds. Some participants, however, cited evidence that workers in some sectors were still in short supply and saw signs that the labor market remained resilient. M2 increased strongly in January and February, boosted primarily by heightened demands for the relative safety and liquidity of money market mutual funds. Although industrial production rose in March, production over the first quarter as a whole was soft, having declined, on average, in January and February. Views varied about the likely pace and vigor of the recovery through 2009, although all participants projected GDP growth to be at or above trend in 2010. Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction, and the rise in energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. Excluding these categories, core consumer price inflation was elevated in June but, on balance, was running this year at about the same rate as last year. Conditions in short-term funding markets remained strained for most of the intermeeting period and deteriorated considerably just before the FOMC meeting. Under this program, the Treasury issued short-term bills over and above its regular borrowing program, with the proceeds deposited at the Federal Reserve. Readings on consumer sentiment remained at very low levels by historical standards through the end of 2008 and showed little improvement in early January. The decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) at its December 15-16 meeting reportedly were more aggressive than investors had been expecting. Participants also noted that other categories of business investment were contracting; they expected the rapid contraction to continue in coming quarters. The Committee anticipates that a gradual recovery in economic activity will begin later this year, but the downside risks to that outlook are significant. Consumer purchases appeared to have stabilized after falling in the second half of 2008, and the steep decline in the housing sector seemed to be abating. Outside of high-tech and transportation, real spending on equipment dropped again in the second quarter but at a slower pace than in the previous quarter. These factors, along with past declines in wealth that had been only partly offset by recent increases in equity prices, would weigh on consumer spending. The level of debt of the private domestic nonfinancial sector declined again in the second quarter, as both household and nonfinancial business debt fell. Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations rose in August following a lull in July; the rebound was particularly robust for speculative-grade firms. Although recent data indicated that the pace at which employment was declining had slowed, job losses remained sizable and the unemployment rate was high. Household spending seems to be stabilizing, but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Many participants noted that employment had increased in recent months, and that they expected a further firming of labor market conditions going forward. Yields on nominal Treasury coupon securities were volatile and ended the period somewhat lower, particularly for intermediate- and longer-term maturities. Participants agreed that such factors were contributing to continued high unemployment but differed in their assessments of the magnitude of such effects. Banks continued to boost regulatory capital ratios, likely, at least in part, in anticipation of the need to eventually meet stricter Basel III standards. The Committee decided to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings into longer-term Treasury securities. Most of the research reviewed suggested that structural unemployment had likely risen in recent years, but by less than actual unemployment had increased. The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons declined further over the past two months, but long-duration unemployment was still elevated. The SOMA portfolio could be reduced by selling securities outright, by ceasing the reinvestment of principal payments on its securities holdings, or both. Finally, participants encouraged further staff work to improve these models by, for example, expanding the range of questions they can be used to address. After decelerating in the preceding two months, indexes of U.S. consumer prices declined in June, reflecting a substantial drop in consumer energy prices. Inflation picked up earlier in the year, mainly reflecting higher prices for some commodities and imported goods, as well as the supply chain disruptions. On net, equity prices for U.S. banking firms were not much changed over the period since the last FOMC meeting, while their CDS spreads were a bit higher. After falling sharply in August and early September, foreign equity prices rose, with stocks in the euro area outperforming those in most other economies. In November, nominal retail sales, excluding purchases at motor vehicle and parts outlets, expanded further, and sales of light motor vehicles stepped up. Household spending has continued to advance, but business fixed investment appears to be increasing less rapidly and the housing sector remains depressed. The Committee also anticipates that inflation will settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. Factory output was boosted by a sizable expansion in the production of motor vehicles, but there also were solid and widespread gains in other industries. Labor market conditions had improved further: Payroll employment had continued to expand, and the unemployment rate had declined notably in recent months. Flight-to-safety flows helped push yields on both U.K. and German 10-year sovereign debt to record lows before these rates partly retraced their declines. These economic projections and policy assessments are described in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is attached as an addendum to these minutes. Financial conditions in the commercial real estate market remained somewhat strained against a backdrop of weak fundamentals and still-tight underwriting. These economic projections and policy assessments are described in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is attached as an addendum to these minutes. The survey of primary dealers conducted prior to the October meeting showed that the expected size of the SOMA at the end of 2013 had risen significantly. These economic projections and policy assessments are described in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is attached as an addendum to these minutes. Private nonfarm employment increased at a modest rate in January but expanded more briskly in February, while government employment continued to decrease. These economic projections and policy assessments are described in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is attached as an addendum to these minutes. Economic growth in foreign economies overall in the first quarter of 2013 showed only a small improvement from that registered in the second half of 2012. However, growth in business investment spending slowed somewhat, and fiscal policy appeared to be exerting significant near-term restraint on the economy. Real business expenditures on equipment and software appeared to slow somewhat going into the second quarter after expanding modestly earlier in the year. These economic projections and policy assessments are described in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is attached as an addendum to these minutes. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector strengthened further, but fiscal policy was restraining economic growth. The housing sector continued to pick up, as indicated by increases in house prices, low inventories of homes for sale, and strong demand for construction. In nonmortgage credit, automobile loans and student loans both continued to expand rapidly, while balances on revolving consumer credit stayed about flat. Accordingly, the unemployment rate was projected to continue to decline over time toward levels judged to be consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. Private nonfarm employment rose in September but at a slower pace than in the previous month, while total government employment increased at a solid rate. In addition, yields and the value of the dollar fell further after the debt ceiling agreement was reached and in response to the U.S. labor market report. D. Maintain standing foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with foreign banks in accordance with the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations. Although the government shutdown likely damped economic growth somewhat, the extent of restraint on growth from fiscal policy diminished late in the year. Real GDP also increased more slowly in Canada, in part because of severe winter weather, and the pace of economic activity remained weak in the euro area. Most participants projected the improvement in labor market conditions to continue, with the unemployment rate moving down gradually over the medium term. But with the October deficit remaining wider than the monthly average in the third quarter, real net exports looked to be declining in the fourth quarter. Declining oil prices had a smaller effect on inflation in the emerging market economies, reflecting the greater prevalence of administered energy prices.혻 D. Maintain standing foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with foreign banks in accordance with the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations. Gross corporate bond issuance continued to be solid, although speculative-grade bond issuance declined late in the year and remained subdued into January. If this was the case, nominal wage growth could be expected to pick up in coming periods and to resume a more normal relationship with labor market slack. These economic projections and policy assessments are described in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is attached as an addendum to these minutes. In light of the uncertainties attending the outlook for inflation, the Committee agreed that it should continue to monitor inflation developments closely. The rate of private-sector job openings moved up a little, on balance, in March and April, while the rates of hiring and quits were essentially unchanged. A number of participants noted that housing starts and permits rose considerably in recent months, and indicators of sales activity turned more positivee. However, credit conditions remained tight for riskier borrowers, such as those with low credit scores, undocumented income, or high debt-to-income ratios. Consumer credit conditions were also seen as favorable, with business contacts pointing to steady loan growth, especially for auto loans and credit cards. In contrast, inflation in the emerging market economies had risen in recent months as a result of higher food prices and widespread currency depreciation. Although net exports remained soft, household spending and business fixed investment were increasing moderately, and the housing sector recovered further. Gains in employment and income, low gasoline prices, and a high level of consumer confidence were viewed as factors that should support consumer spending. It was noted that beginning the normalization process relatively soon would make it more likely that the policy trajectory after liftoff could be shallow. Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable; market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved slightly lower. D. Maintain standing foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with foreign banks in accordance with the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations. Market expectations for the policy rates of major foreign central banks, which had risen somewhat after the December FOMC meeting, ended the period lower. The foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciated against most currencies, in part because higher oil prices supported the currencies of oil exporters. One participant noted that bankruptcies were rising among natural gas and coal producers as well as among firms engaged in oil exploration and extraction. However, some other participants were uncertain whether economic conditions would soon warrant an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate. Moreover, they indicated that the implications of the implementation framework for the efficiency of the financial system needed to be taken into account. However, the forecast for the second half was lower than in the September projection, primarily reflecting softer-than-expected data on consumer spending. Retailers in a few Districts reported weak to moderate activity, although some contacts thought that holiday sales were likely to peak late in the season. The value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets rose, U.S. equity indexes increased considerably, and credit spreads on U.S. corporate bonds narrowed. Indicators of supply and demand conditions for small business credit were generally unchanged over the past quarter, with demand appearing to remain weak. Consumer loan balances increased at a robust rate through November, with credit card loans, student loans, and auto loans all expanding at a similar pace. Several participants indicated that the timing should be based on a quantitative threshold or trigger tied to the target range for the federal funds rate. A standard measure of the equity risk premium edged lower, declining into the lower quartile of its historical distribution of the previous three decades. Sentiment improved following the outcome of the first round of the French presidential election on April 23, which led to a partial retracement in yields. A few of these participants judged that the degree of additional policy firming that would result from the balance sheet normalization program was modest. The credit quality of state and local governments improved overall, as the number of ratings upgrades notably outpaced the number of downgrades in August. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance. Policymakers pointed to a number of possible reasons for the difficulty in estimating the link between resource utilization and inflation in recent years. Expectations for the federal funds rate at the end of 2019 and 2020, derived from overnight index swap (OIS) quotes, moved up somewhat since late January. In addition, the lower tax withholding resulting from the tax cuts enacted late last year was likely to provide some impetus to spending in coming months. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance. Moreover, the removal of the forward-guidance language and other changes to the statement should streamline and facilitate the Committee's communications. Growth of C&I loans on banks' balance sheets picked up in the fourth quarter, reflecting stronger originations as well as reduced paydowns and loan sales. Purchase mortgage origination activity was flat in December but edged up in January, as mortgage rates remained lower than the peak reached last November. Payroll employment was little changed in February, but job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Payroll employment was little changed in February, but job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. However, several participants remarked that inflation expectations appeared to be at levels consistent with the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective. Market participants pointed to pressures in repurchase agreement (repo) markets as one factor contributing to the uptick in volatility in unsecured rates. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained at or near 2 percent in recent months. A couple of participants commented on the decline in energy prices since last fall and the associated reduction in economic activity in the energy sector. The unemployment rate remained at 3.7 percent through August, and both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio moved up. Overall consumer spending rose steadily in recent months, and sales of light motor vehicles through September maintained their robust second-quarter pace. A few participants observed that the considerations favoring easing at this meeting were reinforced by the proximity of the federal funds rate to the ELB. As that time approaches, the Committee might wish to consider the appropriate maturity composition of reserve management purchases of Treasury securities. Participants who commented on the Desk's proposal for the transition to the ample-reserves regime indicated that they were comfortable with that proposal. In the Treasury market, following several consecutive days of deteriorating conditions, market participants reported an acute decline in market liquidity. This action will help support economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning to the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective. In addition, participants agreed that recent actions taken by the Federal Reserve were essential in helping reduce downside risks to the economic outlook. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index?봳he VIX?봱ose markedly earlier in the period but subsequently declined and ended the period lower. Amid normalizing market conditions, there was little activity in the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility or the Commercial Paper Funding Facility. Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) edged up, on net, remaining close to their pre-pandemic levels. Labor market conditions improved further over October and November, although employment continued to be well below its level at the beginning of the year. The ongoing public health crisis continues to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook. Increased uncertainty over the outlook for longer-term interest rates as well as technical factors may also have contributed to the rise in term premiums. Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market tightened somewhat over the intermeeting period but remained accommodative for stronger borrowers. The ongoing public health crisis continues to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook. The effective federal funds rate and the SOFR were little changed, averaging 7 basis points and 1 basis point, respectively, over the intermeeting period. With the boost to growth from continued reductions in social distancing assumed to fade after 2021, GDP growth was expected to step down in 2022 and 2023. The European Central Bank completed its strategy review, adopting a 2 percent symmetric inflation target, and revised forward guidance on its policy rate. Many participants remarked upon risk-management considerations when contemplating how and when to make changes to the Committee's pace of asset purchases. In addition, a number of foreign central banks had expressed intent to establish access to the Foreign and International Monetary Authority Repo Facility. In addition, the staff pointed to a risk that longer-run inflation expectations would move appreciably higher and lead to persistently elevated inflation. The mean level of gross hedge fund leverage was noteworthy and its distribution was skewed, with particularly high leverage among funds in the top decile. The Desk survey responses suggested expectations for administered rates to be raised by the same increment as the target range for the federal funds rate. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months but continued to be affected by the recent sharp rise in COVID-19 cases. Participants noted that Russia and Ukraine were major suppliers of various commodities used in the production of energy, food, and some industrial inputs. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market OperationsThe manager turned first to a discussion of monetary policy expectations in the United States. Regarding risks related to the balance sheet reduction, several participants noted the potential for unanticipated effects on financial market conditions. Issuance of both agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) stepped down slightly in May from its strong pace earlier in the year. Real goods imports continued to step down from the exceptionally strong March readings, driven by declines in imports of consumer goods and capital goods. Participants mentioned a number of considerations that would likely influence the pace of future increases in the target range for the federal funds rate. Participants commented that higher mortgage interest rates had notably restrained housing activity and that they expected housing activity to remain weak. Household spending rose smartly, outside of autos, and orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods in the business sector were generally quite strong. The construction of nonresidential buildings picked up noticeably so far this year, although activity remained well short of its previous peak in mid-2000. Despite the tighter policy, however, economic growth in the United States' major trading partners appeared likely to remain solid, supporting U.S. exports. In July, indicators for Europe generally moderated, on balance, from their second-quarter levels; those for Canada and Japan, however, slowed more notably. On August 10, the Federal Reserve issued a statement announcing that it was providing liquidity to facilitate the orderly functioning of financial markets. Softer demand for homes amid a reduction in the availability of mortgage credit would likely curtail construction activity through the middle of next year. Members judged that a lowering of the target funds rate was appropriate to help offset the effects of tighter financial conditions on the economic outlook. Similarly, the impaired functioning of financial markets might persist for some time or possibly worsen, with nagativee implications for economic activity. Likewise, notwithstanding a strong preliminary estimate of third-quarter GDP growth in the United Kingdom, more recent surveys pointed to some softening.   In the third quarter, corporate cash flows appeared to have dropped off, leaving firms with diminished internally generated funds for financing investment. Orders and shipments rose somewhat in the fourth quarter, but imports in the first two months of the quarter were below their average in the third quarter. By 2009, the forecasts for both the headline and core PCE price indexes showed inflation receding from its 2008 level, in line with the previous forecasts. Conditions in U.S. financial markets improved somewhat, on balance, over the intermeeting period, but strains in some short-term funding markets increased. In addition, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility drew substantial demand through late March, although the amount outstanding subsequently declined somewhat. However, the index of pending sales agreements--an indicator of existing home sales in coming months--jumped in April to its highest reading in six months. The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in May, as a large increase in exports of goods and services more than offset a moderate increase in imports. Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction, and the rise in energy prices were likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. Consistent with the revision in policy expectations, yields on short- and medium-term nominal Treasury coupon securities fell over the intermeeting period. On the inflation front, headline consumer prices declined in recent months, as energy prices continued to fall and consumer food price increases moderated. Credit outstanding under the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility fell by more than half over the intermeeting period. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range of 0 to혻1/4 percent. Industrial production fell in January and February, with cutbacks again widespread, and capacity utilization in manufacturing declined to a very low level. Domestic demand fell in all major economies, led by double-digit declines in fixed investment and sizable nagativee contributions of inventories to growth. The inventory adjustment process was continuing, housing and consumption demand apparently had leveled off, and financial market strains had eased further. However, overnight interest rates in the euro area declined in the wake of the June 24 injection by the ECB of one-year funds at a fixed rate of 1 percent. The ECB also began its purchases of covered bonds, and yields on intermediate-term European covered bonds declined since the purchases began in early July. In contrast, real gross domestic product (GDP) contracted in the United Kingdom in the third quarter, and real GDP in Canada edged down in July and August. The weakness in labor market conditions remained an important concern to meeting participants, with unemployment expected to remain elevated for some time. Such a development, if not offset by Federal Reserve actions, could give additional impetus to spending and, potentially, to actual and expected inflation. In contrast, the announcement that the Federal Reserve would purchase only about $175 billion of agency debt securities had not been generally anticipated. Commercial bank credit continued to contract in December, as an increase in banks' securities holdings was more than offset by a large drop in total loans. Real outlays on structures outside of the drilling and mining sector fell again in the fourth quarter, and nominal expenditures dropped further in January. A moderate pace of expansion, in turn, would imply only a modest improvement in the labor market this year, with the unemployment rate declining gradually. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 쩌 percent. Participants continued to agree that gradual sales of MBS should be undertaken, at some point, to speed the return to a Treasury-securities-only portfolio. Inflation compensation based on Treasury inflation-protected securities decreased recently in response to low readings on inflation and falling oil prices. At the same time, the core PCE price index moved up only slightly, and the year-over-year increase in the index in June was lower than earlier in the year. Consumer loans at commercial banks were about flat, on balance, as reductions in credit card loans about offset an increase in nonrevolving consumer loans. Accordingly, risk spreads on these governments' bonds, though elevated, generally declined, and European banks' access to dollar funding improved somewhat. Commercial real estate markets continued to face difficult financial conditions, although some further signs emerged that this sector might be stabilizing. Nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding declined noticeably during October and November, in part because some firms reportedly shifted to bond financing. According to the latest Call Report data, bank profitability was little changed in the third quarter, remaining positivee but well below pre-crisis levels. Nominal retail sales, excluding purchases of motor vehicles and parts, rose again in December, following substantial increases in the previous four months. Signs of improvement were evident in the consumer credit market, where issuance of consumer asset-backed securities was strong early in the fourth quarter. Some participants suggested that the increase likely reflected, in part, a decline in investors' perceptions of the near-term risk of further disinflation. Net debt financing by nonfinancial corporations was solid in January and February, although it did not match the sizable amount seen in the fourth quarter. In light of uncertainty about the economic outlook, it was seen as prudent to consider possible exit strategies for a range of potential economic outcomes. Bankers again reported improvements in credit quality, with the volume of nonperforming assets declining at larger banks and leveling off at smaller banks. Issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) slowed further in July and August, and investors appeared to demand greater compensation for risk. Business sentiment had worsened, seemingly in response to weaker economic prospects and increased downside risks to the outlook for U.S. and global growth. Some business contacts reported that their firms had made contingency plans to reduce output and employment if demand for their products were to turn down. While they did not anticipate a downturn in economic activity, several remarked that, with growth slow, the recovery was more vulnerable to adverse shocks. The combination of high energy prices and availability of new drilling technologies was promoting strong growth in investment outlays in the energy sector. Consumer energy prices climbed markedly in February and March, although survey data indicated that gasoline prices stepped down in the first half of April. Recent indicators suggested that foreign economic activity improved on balance in the first quarter, but there were important differences across economies. Moreover, real disposable income rose at a subdued pace in the first quarter of this year, though it received some boost from lower energy prices in April. More recently, average hourly earnings for all employees edged up in April and May, and their rate of increase from 12 months earlier continued to be slow. Consumer credit expanded at a solid pace in recent months, as increases in student loans boosted nonrevolving credit while revolving credit was about flat. Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds picked up in April and May, with net issuance turning positivee for the first time since the beginning of 2011. Members generally expected growth to be moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up very gradually, with the unemployment rate declining only slowly. A final question was whether the statement should also provide forward guidance about the likely path of the federal funds rate after the initial increase. Following the completion of this program, the Committee directs the Desk to resume its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues. For example, one participant argued that purchases should vary incrementally from meeting to meeting in response to incoming information about the economy. Although inflows into emerging market mutual funds continued, they slowed notably in recent weeks, and EME equity indexes were, on average, slightly lower. After appreciating, on balance, since early this year, the dollar depreciated against most currencies, although it continued to appreciate against the yen. Yields on agency MBS rose more than those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities, leaving option-adjusted spreads to Treasury securities notably wider. Inflation was low in the months prior to the meeting, with the trends in all broad measures remaining below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective. Under that outlook, if economic conditions improved broadly as expected, the Committee would moderate the pace of its securities purchases later this year. For several members, the various considerations made the decision to maintain an unchanged pace of asset purchases at this meeting a relatively close call. Consumer price inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, while measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained stable. Following a slowdown in January, nonfinancial corporate bond issuance rebounded in February, with the majority of proceeds going to investment-grade firms. In their discussion of recent financial developments, participants saw financial conditions as generally consistent with the Committee's policy intentions. Two others saw declining credit spreads, particularly on speculative-grade corporate bonds, as consistent with an increase in investors' appetite for risk. While household spending appeared to be rising more rapidly, business fixed investment had edged down and the recovery in the housing sector remained slow. Consumer price inflation was running below the FOMC's longer-run objective of 2 percent, but measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable. Foreign inflation remained generally subdued and in some regions quite low, especially in the euro area, where headline inflation was well below 1 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation had declined somewhat, but survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable. In addition, they decided that the statement should note that the low level of inflation seen of late partly reflected the recent decline in energy prices. Measures of expected long-run inflation from a variety of surveys, including the Michigan survey and the Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers, remained stable. Over the 12 months ending in December, nominal average hourly earnings for all employees increased only slightly faster than core consumer price inflation. That said, many participants agreed that an elevated aggregate capacity for the facility would likely be appropriate only for a short period after liftoff. Consumer price inflation was restrained significantly by declines in energy prices and continued to run below the FOMC's longer-run objective of 2 percent. About 40 percent of firms in the S&P 500 index had reported earnings for the first quarter, with those reports generally viewed as better than anticipated. In the April SLOOS, some large banks reported having eased lending standards for a number of categories of residential mortgage loans in the first quarter. Government bond yields in most advanced foreign economies declined modestly, pushing some yields, particularly in Europe, further into nagativee territory. The foreign exchange value of the dollar increased a bit, on balance, during the intermeeting period against the currencies of major U.S. trading partners. A material slowdown in economic growth in China and potential adverse spillovers to other economies were likely to depress U.S. net exports to some extent. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. The housing market was recovering gradually, with single-family homebuilding continuing to trend up and multifamily construction remaining at a high level. A few participants also indicated that significant risks to financial stability, should they emerge, could alter their view of the appropriate policy path. Inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, held down in part by the effects of declines in energy and non-energy import prices. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. Consistent with the decline in the expected path of the federal funds rate, yields on nominal Treasury securities moved lower over the intermeeting period. Part of the decline likely also reflected an increase in safe-haven demands for low-risk and highly liquid assets amid the turbulence in financial markets. Such a downshift, if it occurred, could increase the economic and financial stresses on other EMEs and on commodity producers, including Canada and Mexico. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets generally remained accommodative, and outstanding student and auto debt continued to grow at a robust pace. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. Consumer loan balances continued to increase at a robust pace through February, and data on bank lending activities suggested further growth through March. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. Although the rate of private-sector job openings remained elevated, the rate of hires declined in both March and April and the rate of quits was unchanged. They also pointed out that core inflation had begun to move up and that the transitory factors that had been holding down headline inflation were receding. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. Also, consumer sentiment as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers remained reasonably upbeat in the second quarter and in early July. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. This bounceback was driven primarily by stronger economic growth in Canada and Mexico, two countries where the second-quarter weakness was most pronounced. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. Al짯though state and local government payrolls expanded in January and February, nominal construction spending by these governments fell sharply in January. The slowing appeared to mainly reflect transitory factors like lower energy consumption induced by warm weather or delays in processing income tax refunds. The larger improvements in the rates for Hispanics and for African Americans mirrored the larger increases in those rates during the most recent recession. Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose only modestly in the first quarter, although monthly data indicated some improvement late in the quarter. Spreads on CMBS over Treasury securities narrowed a little over the intermeeting period and were near the bottom of their ranges of the past several years. The national labor force participation rate was lower in November than it had been in September but remained in the range seen over the past several years. Both starts and building permit issuance for new single-family homes increased somewhat in October, and starts for multifamily units moved up considerably. That said, a number of participants judged that the continued tightening in labor markets was likely to translate into faster wage increases at some point. Weaker-than-expected economic data weighed on market-based measures of expected policy rate paths and on longer-term yields in Canada and in the euro area. In some Districts, reports from business contacts or evidence from surveys pointed to a pickup in wages, particularly for unskilled or entry-level workers. Real GDP growth picked up in the first quarter in several emerging market economies (EMEs), including Mexico, China, and some other parts of emerging Asia. Participants concurred that information received during the intermeeting period had not materially altered their assessment of the outlook for the economy. Developments in emerging market economies (EMEs) and in Europe were the focus of considerable attention by financial market participants over recent weeks. On the downside, trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant nagativee effects on U.S. economic growth. On the downside, trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant nagativee effects on U.S. economic growth. During this time, broad equity indexes declined substantially amid a sharp rise in financial market volatility, and corporate bond spreads widened notably. On the downside, trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant nagativee effects on U.S. economic growth. The potential that various sources of uncertainty might abate more quickly than expected was mentioned as a potential upside risk for the economic outlook. In addition, consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, stepped up in February and early March to an upbeat level. Payroll employment was little changed in February, but job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. However, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had declined and were running below the Committee's 2 percent objective. Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded solidly, on average, in April and May; however, job gains slowed sharply in May after a strong increase in April. In contrast, a couple of participants reported that some recent indicators of housing activity in their Districts had been somewhat more positivee of late. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose in December, and the solid pace of job gains over the second half of 2019 was somewhat above that for the first half. Late in the intermeeting period, short-term funding markets showed signs of stress, with elevated demand for repo funding and increased short-term spreads. In a more adverse scenario, the economy entered recession this year, with a recovery much slower to take hold and not materially under way until next year. With regard to inflation, participants noted that it had been running below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective before the coronavirus outbreak. Over the period, the staff's broad dollar index increased, with the dollar appreciating modestly against AFE currencies and notably against EME currencies. With regard to inflation, participants noted that it had been running below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective before the coronavirus outbreak. Participants generally expected spending on these services to remain subdued for some time and thus to be a restraining factor on the pace of the recovery. Conditions in money market funds (MMFs) were also generally calm over the intermeeting period, and net yields of MMFs remained stable near historical lows. With regard to funding risks, the staff highlighted that structural vulnerabilities in markets for short-term funding and corporate bonds remained present. However, even with the appearance of new strains of the virus, market confidence in the ultimate efficacy of the vaccination efforts seemed to remain high. Participants anticipated consumer spending would be bolstered by the recently enacted fiscal stimulus packages as well as by accommodative monetary policy. Available indicators suggested that equipment and intangibles investment?봯articularly in high-tech categories?봶as increasing solidly in the second quarter. Several participants expressed concern that longer-term inflation expectations might rise to inappropriate levels if elevated inflation readings persisted. Participants agreed that their discussion at this meeting would be helpful background for the Committee's future decisions about modifying asset purchases. Most market participants anticipated that a resolution to the debt ceiling would again be reached without a delayed payment on maturing Treasury securities Private-sector job openings, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, stepped down in August but remained well above pre-pandemic levels. In domestic credit markets, financing conditions faced by nonfinancial firms in capital markets remained highly accommodative over the intermeeting period. Consequently, participants assessed that the criterion of substantial further progress had been met with regard to the Committee's maximum employment goal. Moreover, participants widely cited business contacts feeling confident that they would be able to pass on higher costs of labor and material to customers. Participants agreed that the Committee's criteria of inflation rising to 2 percent and moderately exceeding 2 percent for some time had been more than met. The unemployment rate for African Americans moved higher, and the Hispanic unemployment rate declined; both rates remained well above the national average. Market participants expected an earlier and somewhat faster reduction in System Open Market Account (SOMA) holdings of securities than they did in January. Members also agreed that inflation remained elevated, reflecting continued supply and demand imbalances, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. This reduction, starting on June 1, would work in parallel with increases in the target range for the policy rate in firming the stance of monetary policy. Members also agreed that inflation remained elevated, reflecting continued supply and demand imbalances, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. One reason cited for this moderation was that the purchasing power of households was being reduced by higher prices for food, energy, and other essentials. Bank interest rates for both commercial and industrial (C&I) and commercial real estate (CRE) loans increased in May and were close to pre-pandemic levels. Staff Economic OutlookThe projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the November FOMC meeting was weaker than the September forecast. A number of participants remarked that some businesses were keen to retain workers after their recent experiences of labor shortages and hiring challenges. In addition, the forward price-to-earnings ratio for S&P 500 firms remained above its median value despite the decline in equity prices over the past year. Members concurred that Russia's war against Ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship and was contributing to elevated global uncertainty. The Committee also noted that elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions in economic activity had temporarily depressed output and employment. Most participants expected core inflation to move up slightly in the near term, reflecting some pass-through of increased energy and other commodity prices. The level of output in the current quarter was estimated to be close to the economy's potential and was anticipated to remain so over the projection period. Although fresh comprehensive data were not available, home prices on average appeared still to be rising, but at a slower pace than over the past few years. Data on economic growth outside the United States indicated that the global expansion was firming, a sense amplified by reports from international contacts. The step-down was most pronounced in Japan, where GDP contracted, but was also substantial in the euro area, where total domestic demand rose only slightly. Some survey measures of inflation expectations had edged up in recent months, and longer-term financial market gauges of inflation compensation had climbed. Today's policy action, combined with those taken earlier, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity.혻  The Committee expected inflation to moderate in coming quarters but said that it would be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. Most categories of goods imports rebounded in April from lower levels in March, especially petroleum products, the prices of which had moved sharply higher. Imports of non-oil industrial supplies, capital goods, and automotive products also surged in April, whereas imports of consumer goods expanded more slowly. Yields on sovereign debt in the advanced foreign economies moved up approximately in line with increases in comparable Treasury yields in the United States. Hiring in nonbusiness services, which include the education and health industries, and in natural resources and mining increased in line with recent trends. Vacancy rates for commercial properties moved higher in the first half of the year and the architectural billings index continued to register weak readings. The Committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.\" The Committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.\" Participants generally were of the view that, despite modest improvements in some sectors, conditions in credit markets overall remained severely disrupted. Headline consumer prices fell in November and December, reflecting declines in consumer energy prices; core consumer prices were about flat in those months. Real spending on equipment and software dropped markedly in the first quarter, with declines about as steep and widespread as in the fourth quarter of 2008. Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities fell a bit more than those on their nominal counterparts, which decreased modestly, on net, over the period. Premiums paid for on-the-run Treasury securities fell, and average bid asked spreads for Treasury notes were relatively stable near their pre-crisis levels. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is directed to suspend operations of the Term Securities Lending Facility Options Program (TOP), effective immediately. These spreads narrowed to levels not seen since early 2008, transaction volume rose modestly, and tentative signs of increased liquidity reportedly emerged. The European Central Bank lowered its main policy rate 25 basis points to 1 percent and announced that it would purchase up to ??0 billion in covered bonds. Many participants noted that obtaining financing for commercial real estate projects remained extremely difficult amid worsening fundamentals in the sector. Businesses are cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but appear to be making progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. A jump in gasoline prices pushed up overall consumer price inflation in June, but core consumer price inflation remained relatively stable in recent months. Consistent with reduced concerns about the financial condition of large banking institutions, London interbank offered rates (Libor) continued to edge down. Indicators of consumer sentiment continued to increase, but remained well below pre-recession levels, in part because of concerns about rising unemployment. These factors also contributed to an expected further increase in real GDP growth in 2011, despite an anticipated decline in the impetus from fiscal policy. Market participants reportedly remained concerned about the earnings prospects for banks in an environment of weak economic activity and rising loan losses. In addition, growth abroad had exceeded expectations for some time, potentially providing more support to U.S. exports and domestic growth than anticipated. The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets since the Committee's November 3-4 meeting. The Desk was continuing to develop the capacity to conduct RRPs using agency MBS collateral and anticipated that this work would be completed by the spring. Stronger economic growth abroad was contributing to growth in U.S. exports, thus helping support the recovery in industrial production in the United States. The Committee directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions. Most preferred that the agency debt and MBS held in the portfolio be sold at a gradual pace that would complete the sales about five years after they began. However, many participants noted that while financial markets had improved, bank lending was still contracting and credit remained tight for many borrowers. Economic conditions abroad, especially in several emerging Asian economies, continued to strengthen in recent months, contributing to gains in U.S. exports. The Committee directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions. Crude oil prices declined somewhat over the intermeeting period, a factor that was likely to damp headline inflation at the consumer level in coming months. They observed that a range of measures continued to indicate subdued underlying inflation and that growth in wages and compensation remained quite moderate. Increases in spending for drilling and mining structures were more than offset by continued declines in outlays for other types of nonresidential buildings. Participants noted that households were continuing their efforts to repair their balance sheets, a process that was restraining growth in consumer spending. Nonetheless, many contacts remained cautious about hiring and investment, with some reportedly concerned about the potential effects of government policies. Initial claims for unemployment insurance trended lower in December and early January, and some indicators of job openings and firms' hiring plans improved. The staff revised up its projection for consumer price inflation in the near term, largely because of the recent increases in the prices of energy and food. Core inflation and other indicators of underlying inflation over the medium term had increased modestly in recent months, but their levels remained subdued. Participants were also concerned about the possible effect on financial markets of a failure to raise the statutory federal debt ceiling in a timely manner. A few participants expressed uncertainty about the efficacy of monetary policy in current circumstances but disagreed on the implications for future policy. By contrast, the Japanese economy has begun to recover from the March disaster, with exports and production both retracing much of their substantial losses. Following its August meeting, the ECB expanded and extended its offerings of term liquidity and resumed purchases of sovereign debt in the secondary market. But these influences were still expected to dissipate in coming quarters, as was the temporary upward pressure on motor vehicle prices from low inventories. Another participant, however, noted that it could instead reflect a mismatch between the characteristics of the unemployed and the jobs currently available. Citing concerns over the global economic outlook, the central bank of Brazil reduced its policy rate after having raised it several times earlier this year. The Committee directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions. The Committee directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions. In the leveraged loan market, the extension of loans stepped up somewhat in November but remained sluggish relative to its average pace earlier in the year. M2 expanded at a solid pace in November, likely reflecting increased demand for safe and liquid assets, given concerns over European financial developments. As a precautionary measure, the Bank of England announced a new liquidity facility that will auction term sterling funds against a wide range of collateral. The Committee directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions. Consumer credit increased in November, while delinquency rates on credit card loans in securitized pools held steady in November at historically low levels. One participant again noted reports from some homebuilders suggesting that land prices were edging up and that financing was available from nonbank sources. The Committee directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions. In February, motor vehicle assemblies remained near the strong pace recorded in January; they were scheduled to edge up, on net, through the second quarter. In February, nominal retail sales excluding purchases at motor vehicle and parts outlets increased moderately, while motor vehicle sales continued to climb. The spreads of yields on A2/P2-rated unsecured commercial paper issued by nonfinancial firms over yields on A1/P1-rated issues narrowed slightly on balance. Spreads of three-month euro LIBOR over the OIS rate narrowed, on balance, and European banks' issuance of unsecured senior debt and covered bonds increased. The Committee directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions. Yields and spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds were about unchanged, but yields and spreads on speculative-grade corporate bonds increased somewhat. Bank credit quality and consumer and business loan demand were increasing, although commercial and residential real estate lending remained relatively weak. The Committee directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions. Sales of existing homes were a little higher in April than their monthly average in the first quarter, but the pace of new home sales was roughly unchanged. For the duration of this program, the Committee directs the Desk to suspend its current policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues. The Committee directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions. Private nonfarm employment expanded in June at about the same modest pace as in the second quarter as a whole, and government employment decreased slightly. The production of motor vehicles and parts increased considerably last quarter, but factory output outside of the motor vehicle sector was essentially flat. Regarding the economic outlook, most participants agreed that economic growth was likely to remain moderate over coming quarters and then pick up gradually. For the duration of this program, the Committee directs the Desk to suspend its current policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues. The Committee directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions. However, some indicators pointed to modest improvement in this sector, and issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities was solid in the third quarter. Several participants mentioned that the cautious posture of businesses was apparent in national and regional surveys of plans of both large and small firms. In February, nominal retail sales, excluding those at motor vehicle and parts outlets, increased at a strong rate, while light motor vehicle sales edged up. Real state and local government purchases also decreased somewhat in the first quarter, as state and local construction expenditures continued to decline. 혻 The staff reported on potential risks to financial stability, including the stability of banking firms, nonbank financial intermediaries, and asset markets. Nonetheless, applications for new mortgages declined only modestly, apparently supported by improvements in labor market conditions and some pent-up demand. The unemployment rate edged down to 7.2 percent in September; both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio were unchanged. Nonetheless, it was noted that the stance of fiscal policy was likely to remain one of the most important headwinds restraining growth over the medium term. The unemployment rate stayed at 6.7 percent in March, but both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio increased slightly. First-quarter earnings reports for large banking organizations were mixed, and the stock prices of such firms generally underperformed broad equity indexes. Real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products were estimated to have increased slowly in the first quarter as a whole. Inflation was continuing to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, reflecting in part continued reductions in oil prices and falling import prices. The staff's forecast for inflation in 2016 and 2017 was essentially unchanged, with inflation projected to remain below the Committee's 2 percent objective. Participants discussed the economic conditions that they anticipate will prevail at the time they expect it will be appropriate to begin normalizing policy. It was noted that the market-based measures had tracked quite closely the movements in crude oil prices over the period, first rising and then falling back. Others, however, viewed the strength in the labor market in recent months as potentially signaling a stronger-than-expected bounceback in economic activity. On the other hand, if productivity growth remained weak, the labor market might tighten more quickly and inflation might rise more rapidly than anticipated. Business fixed investment remained soft even as the drag from the sharp contraction in drilling rigs over the first half of this year appeared to be fading. The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced but is monitoring developments abroad. Although net exports had been soft and inventory accumulation appeared to have slowed, major domestic components of spending were increasing at solid rates. Participants also discussed the implications of economic conditions going forward for the likely future path of the target range for the federal funds rate. Many participants expressed a view that the global economic and financial situation still posed appreciable downside risks to the domestic economic outlook. Households' net worth was boosted by the rise in equity prices over the intermeeting period and by further strong increases in home values through February. They also agreed that since the beginning of the year, the housing sector had improved further, but business fixed investment and net exports had been soft. The expected policy path of the federal funds rate implied by market quotes was little changed, on net, but fluctuated notably over the intermeeting period. However, the projected step-up in real GDP growth over the second half of this year was marked down a little, partly reflecting softer news on construction. In the agricultural sector, lower crop prices continued to weigh on profit margins, farm income was expected to fall, and loan repayment rates had declined. However, participants noted that economic growth in many foreign economies remained subdued, and inflation rates abroad generally continued to be quite low. The unemployment rate dropped markedly to 4.6 percent in November; a few participants suggested that part of the decline might be reversed in coming months. Participants agreed that it was too early to know what changes in these policies would be implemented and how such changes might alter the economic outlook. They pointed to a number of risks that, if realized, might call for a different policy trajectory than they currently thought most likely to be appropriate. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. It was noted that recent increases in consumer energy prices could cause inflation to temporarily reach or even rise a bit above 2 percent in the near term. Members also reiterated that they expected that economic conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate. On net, foreign yields declined somewhat less than U.S. yields, contributing to a modest depreciation of the dollar against both the AFE and EME currencies. Members also agreed that they would carefully monitor actual and expected developments in inflation in relation to the Committee's symmetric inflation goal. The rate of private-sector job openings decreased in May after having risen for a couple of months, while the quits rate and the hiring rate both increased. While participants generally saw the risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced, they agreed that inflation developments should be monitored closely. A majority of participants noted that a stronger outlook for economic growth raised the likelihood that further gradual policy firming would be appropriate. Members also agreed that they would carefully monitor actual and expected developments in inflation in relation to the Committee's symmetric inflation goal. Alternatively, the IOER rate could be lowered 5 basis points at a meeting in which the Committee left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged. Members also agreed that they would carefully monitor actual and expected developments in inflation in relation to the Committee's symmetric inflation goal. As a result, agency MBS principal payments could rise above the monthly redemption cap in some future scenarios and thus require MBS reinvestment purchases. The issuance of institutional leveraged loans was strong in April and May; meanwhile, corporate bond issuance was weak, likely reflecting seasonal patterns. Many participants saw potential downside risks to economic growth and inflation associated with political and economic developments in Europe and some EMEs. On the upside, household spending and business investment could expand faster than the staff projected, supported in part by the tax cuts enacted last year. On the down-side, trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant nagativee effects on U.S. economic growth. In China, investors were concerned about the apparent slowing of economic expansion and the implications of continued trade tensions with the United States. Investors also reacted to some large firms raising concerns about the effect of rising costs on their future profitability in their latest earnings reports. Credit card loan growth showed signs of moderating amid rising interest rates and reported tightening of lending standards at the largest credit card banks. On the upside, household spending and business investment could expand faster than the staff projected, supported in part by the tax cuts enacted last year. Household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated recently from its rapid pace earlier in the year. On the upside, household spending and business investment could expand faster than the staff projected, supported in part by the tax cuts enacted last year. On the upside, household spending and business investment could expand faster than the staff projected, supported in part by the tax cuts enacted last year. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market OperationsThe manager of the SOMA reviewed developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period. Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) spreads widened slightly over the intermeeting period but remained near the low end of their post-crisis range. Partly reflecting that combination of developments, several participants had revised down their SEP estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment. Participants noted that readings on overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had come in lower than expected over recent months. However, new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys pointed toward continued softness in manufacturing production in coming months. Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) spreads widened slightly over the intermeeting period but remained near the low end of their post-crisis range. Staff Economic OutlookThe projection for U.S. real GDP growth prepared by the staff for the January FOMC meeting was stronger than in the previous forecast. However, some encouraging signs had come from China in recent weeks in the form of indications of increasing production and of more purchases of U.S. goods. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market OperationsThe System Open Market Account (SOMA) manager first discussed developments in financial markets. Concerns about the finances of state and local governments contributed to a marked deterioration in credit conditions in the municipal bond market in March. Though banks in the April SLOOS reported tightening standards on new consumer loans, respondents also experienced weaker demand for all consumer loan types. Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms eased somewhat over the intermeeting period, though they remained moderately strained for lower-rated borrowers. Risk spreads across a range of fixed-income markets had narrowed as the intense flight to safety witnessed in financial markets in the spring ebbed further. Measured on a quarterly basis, however, it appeared that real gross domestic product (GDP) had decreased at a historically rapid rate in the second quarter. A majority of participants commented on yield caps and targets?봞pproaches that cap or target interest rates along the yield curve?봞s a monetary policy tool.

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market OperationsThe System Open Market Account (SOMA) manager first discussed developments in financial markets. Industrial production advanced further in the fourth quarter, led by a solid gain in manufacturing output, but had not yet overtaken its pre?몆andemic level. Stocks in cyclically sensitive industries such as energy, banking, and small caps recorded sizable gains, while other sectors experienced mixed performance. Contacts reported that the earlier increases in yields drew in a range of investors, including foreign institutions, pension funds, and insurance companies. Progress on vaccinations would likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy, but risks to the economic outlook remained. The Committee's standard of \"substantial further progress\" was generally seen as not having yet been met, though participants expected progress to continue. Progress on vaccinations would likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy, but risks to the economic outlook remained. Progress on vaccinations would likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy, but risks to the economic outlook remained. They also noted, however, that the spread of the Delta variant may temporarily delay the full reopening of the economy and restrain hiring and labor supply. Progress on vaccinations would likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy, but risks to the economic outlook remained. The members commented that, since then, the economy had made progress toward these goals, and they agreed to continue to assess progress in coming meetings. Recent monthly increases in average hourly earnings appeared to reflect a combination of continued strong labor demand and increased difficulties in hiring. Progress on vaccinations would likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy, but risks to the economic outlook remained. Progress on vaccinations would likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy, but risks to the economic outlook remained. In the Open Market Desk's surveys of primary dealers and market participants, the median forecast for headline PCE inflation in 2021 was revised up notably. The export rebound was broad based, with sizable increases in real exports of industrial supplies, capital goods, agricultural products, and consumer goods. Real imports were little changed in October, with increases in imports of automotive products and consumer goods offset by a decline in industrial supplies. The share of Paycheck Protection Program loans in C&I loan balances at banks continued to fall in the third quarter amid ongoing forgiveness of those loans. Participants discussed the progress the economy had made toward the criteria the Committee had specified in its forward guidance for the federal funds rate. Longer-term private borrowing rates also moved higher, with 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates rising above 5 percent to the highest levels in over a decade. Market participants noted that ongoing uncertainty about the near-term path of Federal Reserve policy had increased demand for very short-dated investments. Against this backdrop, all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting. Yields on nonfinancial corporate bonds remained well above pre-pandemic levels, and new issuance spreads for institutional leveraged loans ticked up in May. Some participants commented on the recent reduction in temporary employment, which previously had often preceded more widespread reductions in labor demand. With many energy facilities in the Gulf region still closed, output at mines, which is defined to include oil and gas extraction, slipped further in October. Consumer sentiment picked up in November and early December; some survey measures of confidence returned to the range seen during the first half of the year. Excluding utilities, industrial production posted a sizable gain in January before flattening out in February, pointing to a solid rise in the first quarter. Consumer credit rebounded some in January after contracting in the fourth quarter because of elevated charge-offs related to the spike in bankruptcy filings. Inflation compensation for 2007 declined modestly, perhaps reflecting the further drop in spot energy prices, but was largely unchanged at longer maturities. While fleet sales of light vehicles appeared to have moved up in July and August, sales of medium and heavy trucks remained below the second-quarter average. Step-downs in price inflation for prescription drugs, motor vehicles, and nonmarket services accounted for nearly all of the deceleration in core PCE prices. On balance, real GDP growth for 2008 was projected to slow to a pace a bit below that of its potential, and unemployment was expected to creep up slightly.   Conditions in the labor market deteriorated noticeably, with private payroll employment posting a small decline in December and the unemployment rate rising. Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial firms was robust in March and the first half of April and included a small amount of issuance by speculative-grade firms. The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability. Even so, the months' supply of new homes for sale remained extremely elevated relative to the level that prevailed before the downturn in the housing market. Several indexes indicated that house prices had declined substantially over the past 12 months, and these prices appeared to remain on a downward trajectory. Two initiatives were introduced over the intermeeting period to help manage the expansion of the balance sheet and promote control of the federal funds rate. Industrial production, excluding special hurricane- and strike-related effects, fell markedly in November after sizable declines in the preceding two months. Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) fell for the fifth straight month in October, with the slowdown evident in nearly all broad spending categories. In the business sector, investment in equipment and software appeared to be contracting at a faster rate in the fourth quarter than during the third quarter. In response to evidence of a slowdown in economic activity and a rapid waning of inflationary pressures, central banks around the world eased policy sharply. Those pressures were seen as likely to continue to abate because of the emergence of substantial slack in resource utilization and diminishing pricing power. The members emphasized that their expectation about the path of the federal funds rate was conditioned on their view of the likely path of economic activity. Financial markets continued to be strained overall, credit remained unusually tight for both households and businesses, and equity prices had fallen further. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent.

To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to혻1/4 percent. In contrast, activity in the much smaller multifamily sector fell significantly further, reflecting a sharp deterioration in the fundamentals in that sector. Home equity loans edged down--the first monthly decline in this category since October 2006--partly because of banks' reductions in existing lines of credit.

Interest rates for conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages changed little in recent months and remained at levels that were very low by historical standards. Market participants pointed to flight-to-quality flows and greater concern about the economic outlook as factors boosting the demand for Treasury securities. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent. Instead, businesses had continued to meet growth in demand for their products largely through productivity gains and by increasing existing employees' hours.

A number of participants observed that the sluggish pace of growth and continued high levels of slack left the economy exposed to potential nagativee shocks. In addition, members wanted to consider further the most effective framework for calibrating and communicating any additional steps to provide such stimulus.

Nominal imports of petroleum products rose sharply, reflecting both higher prices and greater volumes; imports in other major categories rose solidly on net. Currency continued to advance at a relatively fast rate in January and February, likely boosted by a strong expansion in foreign holdings of U.S. bank notes. Movements in 10-year sovereign bond yields in Europe and Canada mirrored those in equity prices, climbing early in the intermeeting period but falling later. Survey-based measures of inflation expectations also indicated that longer-term expected inflation had risen much less than near-term inflation expectations.

Starts of new single-family homes declined in July, but permits increased, which pointed to further gains in single-family construction in the coming months. Long-run inflation expectations from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Survey of Professional Forecasters continued to be stable in the third quarter. Spreads of shorter-term yields on peripheral euro-area sovereign bonds over those on comparable-maturity German bunds declined substantially over the period. The staff also did not find evidence that excessive risk-taking was widespread, although such behavior had appeared in a few smaller and less liquid markets. Business contacts in many parts of the country were reported to be highly uncertain about the outlook for the economy and for fiscal and regulatory policies. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent. Some participants noted that the outlook for business spending would likely be difficult to assess until the direction of U.S. fiscal policy becomes clearer.

Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy is restraining economic growth. Corporate bond yields rose significantly over the intermeeting period, and their spreads relative to comparable-maturity Treasury yields edged higher on net. Uncertainties about regulatory issues and fiscal policies as well as weak economic activity abroad were cited as factors weighing on business decisionmaking. Some businesses, particularly smaller firms, were again reported to be concerned about the implications of new health-care regulations for their labor costs. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy is restraining economic growth. The PCE price index for items excluding food and energy rose at a subdued rate in the second quarter and was around 1-1/4 percent higher than a year earlier. Participants discussed how to reconcile the notable decline in the unemployment rate over the past year with the only moderate pace of expansion in real GDP. In addition, there was not complete consensus within the Committee that headwinds were the only explanation for the low expected future path of policy rates. The staff continued to forecast that inflation would be modest, on net, through early next year but higher than its low level in the first half of this year. In addition, the staff revised downward its view of the pace at which potential output had increased over recent years and would increase this year and next. A number of participants noted that recent economic news had reinforced their confidence in their projection of moderate economic growth over the medium run. Overall, most participants still viewed the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having become more nearly balanced in recent months. The Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions. The Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions. The average pace of employment gains stepped up, and the unemployment rate declined markedly in April and held steady in May, although it was still elevated. Permits for single-family homes, which are usually a better indicator of the underlying pace of residential construction, increased only a little on balance. Aggregate wage measures continued to rise at only a modest rate, and reports on wages from business contacts and surveys in a number of Districts were mixed. Household spending appears to be rising moderately and business fixed investment resumed its advance, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow.

The Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions. In addition, members considered the advantages and disadvantages of adding language to the statement to acknowledge recent developments in financial markets. It was noted that to the extent that such guidance can be effectively communicated, the precise date of liftoff becomes less important for economic outcomes. In their discussion of these issues, participants generally agreed that it was very important for the commencement of policy firming to proceed successfully. The unemployment rate declined to 5.6 percent in December, the labor force participation rate decreased, and the employment-to-population rate was unchanged. The decline in energy prices was also seen as potentially exerting a stronger-than-anticipated positivee effect on growth in the domestic economy and abroad. However, a few others saw only a limited degree of remaining labor underutilization or anticipated that underutilization would be eliminated relatively soon. After taking into account deals in the pipeline for March, issuance in the first quarter of 2015 was expected to be the strongest since the financial crisis. Measures of expected longer-run inflation from a variety of surveys, including the Michigan survey and the Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers, remained stable. Consistent with this downside risk to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as skewed somewhat to the upside. This final set of changes codifies the approach used in recent years of promptly referring material potential breaches to the Board's inspector general (IG). The increased reluctance to hold risky assets was associated with a sharp decline in equity prices and a notable widening in risk spreads on corporate bonds. Although the unemployment rate edged up to 5.0 percent, both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio continued to increase. A few participants also reported that low prices for agricultural commodities continued to strain the profitability of farming operations in their Districts. Equity price indexes and corporate bond spreads were little changed, on net, and, in aggregate, corporations continued to tap credit markets at a solid pace. Indicators suggested that refinancing activity continued to increase and reached its highest level since 2013 in response to the low level of mortgage rates. Domestic and global asset markets remained relatively calm over the intermeeting period, and U.S. financial conditions continued to be broadly accommodative. A couple of participants reported plans for a pickup in capital spending by businesses in their Districts, driven by stronger demand and increasing revenues. In contrast, conditions in the agricultural sector remained depressed, and a couple of reports highlighted softer activity in some service-sector industries. The deputy manager followed with a briefing on developments in money markets, market expectations for the System's balance sheet, and open market operations. Real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property seemed to be increasing further after rising at a solid pace in the first quarter. One-month-ahead option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index--the VIX--was little changed, on net, and remained near the lower end of its historical range. On a year-over-year basis, overall credit card balances continued to grow in April at a robust rate, although the pace had moderated a bit from that of 2016. Market-based measures of inflation compensation had remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had changed little, on balance. One participant reported that financial market contacts did not see the relatively flat slope of the yield curve as signaling an increased risk of recession. Members continued to anticipate that the federal funds rate would likely remain, for some time, below levels that were expected to prevail in the longer run. Members continued to anticipate that the federal funds rate would likely remain, for some time, below levels that were expected to prevail in the longer run. Conditions in both the manufacturing and service sectors in several Districts were reportedly strong and were seen as contributing to solid investment gains. In U.S. money markets, the spread between the three-month London interbank offered rate and three-month overnight index swap (OIS) rates continued to narrow. On net, financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed in recent months and remained largely supportive of growth in household spending. The equity market was quite volatile over the intermeeting period, with U.S. stock prices down as much as 10 percent at one point before recovering somewhat. While the funds rate seemed to have stabilized recently, there remained some risk that it could continue to drift higher before the Committee's next meeting. Overall consumer spending rose steadily in recent months, and light motor vehicle sales stepped up to a robust pace in September and edged higher in October. Stock prices in the basic materials and industrial sectors underperformed the broader market, reportedly reflecting an increase in trade tensions with China. Over the 2018??0 period, output was forecast to rise at a rate above or at the staff's estimate of potential growth and then slow to a pace below it in 2021. Participants also noted significant uncertainties surrounding their economic outlooks, including those related to global economic and financial developments. Conversely, a standing facility with a rate set at a relatively low level could result in larger and more frequent repo operations than would be appropriate. Meanwhile, the 3-year-ahead measure from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Survey of Consumer Expectations remained near its historical low in December. Available indicators suggested that both exports and imports likely declined in February, in part reflecting disruptions related to the coronavirus outbreak. Some participants expressed concern that low energy prices, if they were to persist, had the potential to create a wave of bankruptcies in the energy sector. Lenders indicated that they had tightened loan standards on small business loans or discontinued lending to such borrowers altogether (other than PPP loans). The pace of nonfinancial corporate bond defaults in July was also notably lower than in April and May but was still elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, District contacts indicated that fiscal policy had helped support small businesses, while federal aid payments had helped support farm incomes. A couple of participants saw an upside risk that further fiscal stimulus could be larger than anticipated, though it might come later than had been expected. Participants universally recognized his great leadership and intellectual contributions to the work of the Committee as well as his warm and generous spirit. Some who commented noted that the SEP serves a valuable role in illustrating how participants' policy assessments respond to changes in the economic outlook. There continued to be no participation in the Fed's repurchase agreement (repo) operations, and participation in the Fed's reverse repo facility was minimal. Business investment in equipment and intangibles was continuing to increase in the first quarter after rising appreciably in the fourth quarter of last year. Goods imports were held back in February by weakness in imports for automotive products and consumer goods but remained higher than their pre-pandemic level. Participation in the Fed's reverse repo facility increased from minimal levels to an average of $47 billion and reached $134 billion on the quarter-end date. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 3.1 percent over the 12 months ending in April. Measures of inflation compensation at shorter horizons moved down somewhat, on net, while measures of longer-term inflation compensation were little changed. In addition, the increased prevalence of new virus variants, particularly the Delta variant, underscored the continued uncertainty about the foreign outlook. Longer-dated Treasury yields fell, largely reflecting declines in real yields, while longer-horizon forward measures of inflation compensation also declined. Financing conditions in the municipal bond market remained accommodative over the intermeeting period, with municipal bond yields edging down to record lows. With regard to the Committee's maximum-employment goal, participants considered the cumulative degree of improvement in the labor market since December 2020. In the United States, the five-year measure of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) rose by around 45 basis points. Housing demand remained strong, but indicators of housing-sector activity, including housing starts and home sales, were generally little changed in October. Financial Developments and Open Market OperationsThe manager turned first to a review of domestic financial market developments over the intermeeting period. With regard to the economic outlook, participants agreed that the Omicron wave of the pandemic would weigh on economic activity in the first quarter of 2022. Participants judged that the invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. Credit in the residential mortgage market remained widely available for borrowers with higher credit ratings but tight for households with low credit scores. Yields on Japanese government securities, however, ended the period little changed, as the Bank of Japan reaffirmed its accommodative monetary policy stance. Participants observed that, in aggregate, household-sector balance sheets were still strong and that this factor would continue to support consumer spending. In their discussion of prices, participants indicated that their concerns about near-term inflation pressures had eased somewhat over the intermeeting period. In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that, although recent economic data had been uneven, the expansion in economic activity appeared solid. Some meeting participants expressed surprise at how little of the previous rise in energy prices appeared to have passed through into core inflation measures. After large gains in the preceding two months, manufacturing output declined in August, held down by a decrease in the production of motor vehicles and parts. Demand was restrained by deteriorating conditions in the subprime mortgage market and by an increase in rates for thirty-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages. Some indicators from the household survey also suggested softening in the labor market, but the unemployment rate held steady at 4.7 percent through November. The index for motor vehicles and parts fell for the third consecutive month, and the index for construction supplies moved down for the fourth straight month. Participants also related anecdotal evidence of firms facing increasing input cost pressures and in some cases being able to pass on those costs to consumers. The arrangement with the Bank of Canada is in the amount of $2 billion equivalent and that with the Banco de Mexico is in the amount of $3 billion equivalent. M2 expanded briskly again in March, as households continued to seek the relative liquidity and safety of liquid deposits and retail money market mutual funds. The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.\" Although downside risks to growth remained, they appeared to have diminished somewhat, and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations increased. The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.\" Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction, and some slowing in export growth are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. In particular, the Committee anticipates that weak economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time. Participants generally saw credit conditions as extremely tight, with financial markets fragile and some parts of the banking sector under substantial stress. The debt of the domestic private nonfinancial sector appeared to have contracted in the first quarter at about the same pace as in the fourth quarter of 2008. Growth of consumption expenditures was likely to be restrained by the weakness in labor markets and the lagged effects of past reductions in household wealth. The analysis indicated that the Federal Reserve was likely to earn substantial net interest income over the next few years under most interest rate scenarios. The monthly pattern in expenditures was significantly affected by swings in motor vehicle sales during and after the government's \"cash-for-clunkers\" program. Indicators of economic activity in the advanced foreign economies during the third quarter were mixed, but consistent with economic recovery in the aggregate. In contrast, the federal government continued to issue debt at a brisk pace, and gross issuance of state and local government debt remained strong in October. Also in the third quarter, vacancy rates on nonresidential properties rose further, and property prices continued to fall amid difficult financing conditions. Household spending is expanding at a moderate rate but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Real spending on drilling and mining structures picked up strongly over the second half of last year in response to the rebound in oil and natural gas prices. The trade-weighted value of the dollar changed little, on net; gains against the euro and yen were offset by declines against many emerging market currencies. Most participants again projected that the economy would grow somewhat faster in 2011 and 2012, generating a more pronounced decline in the unemployment rate. Credit card ABS issuance remained subdued, partly reflecting regulatory changes that made financing credit card receivables via securitization less desirable. U.S. industrial production slowed noticeably in August and September, hiring at private businesses remained modest, and the unemployment rate stayed elevated. Outstanding residential mortgage debt was estimated to have contracted in the third quarter at about the average rate of decline seen over the preceding year. However, others pointed out that it was unlikely that the outlook would change by enough to substantiate any adjustments to the program before its completion. Participants' judgment that the recovery was gaining traction reflected both the incoming economic indicators and information received from business contacts. With respect to the statement to be released following the meeting, members decided to note the further improvement in economic activity and in labor markets. Liquid deposits, the largest component of M2, maintained a solid rate of expansion, likely reflecting the very low opportunity costs of holding such deposits. Supply chain disruptions associated with the earthquake in Japan continued to hinder production at motor vehicle manufacturers and the firms that supply them. Real federal government purchases appeared to increase in recent months as defense expenditures continued to rise from unusually low levels early in the year. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York may lend securities on longer than an overnight basis to accommodate weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions.4. In December, however, nominal retail sales excluding purchases at motor vehicle and parts outlets declined, and sales of motor vehicles also dropped slightly. Consequently, the Committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline gradually toward levels that it judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. The level of M2 and its largest component?봪iquid deposits?봱emained elevated, apparently reflecting investors' continued desire to hold safe and liquid assets. Measures of consumer price inflation declined over the intermeeting period, mainly reflecting reductions in oil and gasoline prices since earlier in the year. Consumer and business loans were increasing, although credit standards remained tight and commercial and residential real estate lending were relatively weak. In one District, business surveys pointed to further growth; however, readings on forward-looking indicators of orders around the country were less positivee. Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds reached a record low level, and their spreads to yields on comparable-maturity Treasury securities narrowed on net. The unemployment rate declined to 7.7 percent in November, and the labor force participation rate in that month was at the same level as in the third quarter. State and local government payrolls decreased on net over October and November, and nominal construction spending by these governments edged lower in October. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated, and part of the decline in unemployment in November was attributable to a drop in labor force participation. If these spillovers are significant, then purchases of longer-term Treasury securities might be preferred, in light of the depth and liquidity of that market. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York may lend securities on longer than an overnight basis to accommodate weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions.5. In emerging market economies (EMEs), an increase in exports contributed to a pickup in the pace of economic growth in the fourth quarter, including for China. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector had strengthened further, but fiscal policy was restraining economic growth. In September, nominal retail sales, excluding those at motor vehicle and parts outlets, increased significantly, while sales of light motor vehicles declined. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York may lend securities on longer than an overnight basis to accommodate weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions.5. In considering forward guidance about the target federal funds rate, all members agreed to retain the thresholds-based language employed in recent statements. A couple of participants suggested that adequate control of short-term rates might be accomplished with a very wide spread or even without an ON RRP facility. The VIX, an index of option-implied volatility for one-month returns on the S&P 500 index, continued to decline and ended the period near its historical lows. Household spending appeared to be rising moderately and business fixed investment resumed its advance, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow. Participants expressed general support for the normalization approach outlined by the staff, though some noted reservations about one or more of its features. By keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, this policy was expected to help maintain accommodative financial conditions. The downside risks to the forecast for inflation were seen as having increased somewhat, partly reflecting the recent soft monthly readings on core inflation. Many participants continued to judge that a deterioration in the foreign economic situation could pose downside risks to the outlook for U.S. economic growth. Over the intermeeting period, most broad U.S. equity price indexes moved down a bit, on net, amid mixed macroeconomic news and little information on earnings. Members thus saw economic conditions as continuing to approach those consistent with warranting a start to the normalization of the stance of monetary policy. With respect to consumer spending, the incoming data had been uneven but participants cited reports from contacts suggesting a pickup since the first quarter. Over the 12 months ending in August, total consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) edged up, while the core CPI increased 1-3/4 percent. Data on overnight index swap rates indicated that investors marked down the expected path of the federal funds rate, on balance, over the intermeeting period. Inflation continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and prices of non-energy imports. In addition, new and revised information on employment in recent months had reduced earlier concerns about a possible slowing of progress in the labor market. Ongoing strong gains in employment and low energy prices were boosting aggregate household real income, and the level of household wealth was relatively high. Some participants viewed a broad range of labor market indicators as well as the recent firming in wages as consistent with a high level of labor utilization. Al짯though sales of light motor vehicles declined in June, the average pace for the second quarter as a whole was essentially the same as in the first quarter. Federal Reserve communications released in conjunction with the June FOMC meeting were interpreted by market participants as more accommodative than expected. The Committee was also briefed on planned revisions to the policies of the Open Market Desk on counterparties for domestic and foreign open market operations. They cautioned that postponing policy firming for too long could push the unemployment rate markedly below its longer-run normal rate over the next few years. Vulnerabilities emanating from leverage in the financial sector remained low, as the largest U.S. banks had strong regulatory capital and liquidity positions. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance. However, members emphasized that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the evolution of the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Participants generally agreed that it would be appropriate to continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. Building permit issuance for new single-family homes--which tends to be a good indicator of the underlying trend in construction--declined in July and August. Members acknowledged that hurricane-related disruptions and rebuilding would continue to affect economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term. Other indicators, such as consumer and business surveys of job availability and job openings, also pointed to a further tightening in labor market conditions. By unanimous vote, the Committee revised its Program for Security of FOMC Information with a set of technical changes to update references to other documents. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low, and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance. Futures quotes indicated that market participants placed high odds on a further quarter-point firming in the federal funds rate at the September FOMC meeting. Over the 2018-20 period, output was projected to rise at a rate above or at the staff's estimate of potential growth and then slow to a pace below it in 2021. In reviewing money market developments, the deputy manager noted that federal funds continued to trade at rates close to the interest on excess reserves rate. The EFFR was consistently equal to the rate of interest on excess reserves, while take-up in the overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility remained low. Agricultural activity remained weak in various areas of the country, with the weakness in part reflecting adverse effects of trade policy on commodity prices. As tax receipts arrived after the tax date, the TGA rose to more than $400 billion, resulting in a sharp decline in reserves over the last two weeks of April. Similarly, sales of light motor vehicles rose sharply in March, although the average pace of sales in the first quarter was slower than in the fourth quarter. Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft were little changed, on net, in February and March, but they rose for the quarter as a whole. Several participants also noted that while the housing sector had been a drag on GDP growth for some time, recent data pointed to some signs of stabilization. Total labor compensation per hour in the business sector increased 1.6 percent over the four quarters ending in the first quarter, slower than a year earlier. With the risks to the forecast for economic activity tilted to the downside, the risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew. With the risks to the forecast for economic activity tilted to the downside, the risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market OperationsThe manager pro tem first reviewed developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period. Further ahead, the path implied by the medians of survey respondents' modal forecasts for the federal funds rate remained essentially flat after this meeting. The rate of private-sector job openings declined in August, and the rate of quits also edged down, but both readings were still at relatively elevated levels. The risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew, in part because of the downside risks to the forecast for economic activity. After particularly strong gross equity issuance in September, initial public offerings declined and seasoned offerings remained solid in October and November. The risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew, in part because of the downside risks to the forecast for economic activity. The risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew, in part because of the downside risks to the forecast for economic activity. The fall in imports, which followed a sizable fourth-quarter decline, was led by lower imports of industrial supplies, automotive products, and capital goods. The 50 basis point decrease in the target range for the federal funds rate announced on March 3 passed through fully to overnight unsecured and secured rates. All saw U.S. economic activity as likely to decline in the coming quarter and viewed downside risks to the economic outlook as having increased significantly. Participants discussed several alternative scenarios with regard to the behavior of economic activity in the medium term that all seemed about equally likely. The disruptions to global economic activity had significantly affected financial conditions and impaired the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Keeping the target range at the ELB would continue to provide support to the economy and promote the Committee's maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Following April's historic plunge, exports and imports of services fell a bit further in May, driven by the continued suspension of most international travel. Alternatively, the Committee could provide more accommodation, if appropriate, by conducting purchases of the same pace and composition over a longer horizon. Credit was broadly available to higher-score borrowers meeting standard conforming loan criteria but tightened further for borrowers with lower credit scores. Bottlenecks in the global semiconductor industry, which had weighed on exports and imports of automotive products this year, continued to do so through April. Members judged that the economic outlook had continued to improve and that the most nagativee effects of the pandemic on the economy most likely had occurred. Staff analysis suggested that the proposed increase was likely to be sufficient to support effective policy implementation for most foreseeable circumstances. Uncertainty around the course of the virus, the resolution of supply constraints, and fiscal measures were cited as presenting both upside and downside risks. For households, the level of consumer debt was largely unchanged on an inflation-adjusted basis, while delinquencies returned to pre-pandemic levels or below. Overall, considerable progress had been made in the transition away from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in cash and derivatives markets. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent imposition of an array of sanctions, the ruble depreciated roughly 40 percent against the dollar. Participants generally agreed that monthly caps of about $60 billion for Treasury securities and about $35 billion for agency MBS would likely be appropriate. Market participants focused on the spread of COVID-19 in China and the effect of zero-COVID policies, which had resulted in increasingly widespread lockdowns. In that context, some participants noted that their contacts had reported that low- and moderate-income consumers were shifting purchases to lower-cost goods. Committee Policy ActionIn their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators of spending and production had softened. Moreover, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) issuance softened somewhat in October amid elevated financing costs and tighter underwriting standards. The VIX?봳he one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500?봡ecreased somewhat but remained slightly above the median range of its historical distribution. Assets in open-end mutual funds that invest in less liquid instruments like bank loans or high-yield corporate bonds have declined notably over the past year. Domestic nonfinancial sector debt appeared to have expanded at a somewhat slower pace in the fourth quarter, down from the rapid increase in the third quarter. Motor vehicle purchases bounced back in late 2005 and early 2006 from the sluggish pace that followed the end of the past summer's \"employee pricing\" programs. More generally, the effects on spending of the substantial increase in short- and intermediate-term rates since June 2004 had probably not yet been fully felt. The arrangement with the Bank of Canada is in the amount of $2 billion equivalent, and that with the Banco de Mexico is in the amount of $3 billion equivalent. The declines in both categories were generally widespread across sectors with the exception of oil imports, which were flat, and imported services, which rose. Over the three months ending in March, the employment cost index for hourly compensation of private industry workers rose at its slowest pace in several years. Low and stable inflation expectations were key to the attainment of the Committee's dual objectives of price stability and maximum sustainable economic growth. Participants noted that inventories of unsold homes had climbed sharply in many areas and that builders were taking a number of measures to reduce inventories. Although owners' equivalent rent decelerated over the past year, this change was largely offset by an acceleration in tenants' rent and lodging away from home. Inflation data had been disappointing in recent months, and a few participants cited anecdotal reports that some firms were able to pass on costs to consumers. Meeting participants discussed the possible costs and benefits of a proposed broadening of eligible collateral for the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF). The reduction in jobs was again widespread, with losses registered at firms in the construction, manufacturing, and professional and business services sectors. However, Federal Reserve actions that increased the availability of Treasury securities to the public apparently helped to improve conditions in those markets. In the forecast prepared for this meeting, the staff made little change to its projection for the growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008 and 2009. The substantial easing of monetary policy to date, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate growth over time. Although downside risks to growth remain, they appear to have diminished somewhat, and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased. Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction, and some slowing in export growth were likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. First, the Treasury announced a voluntary capital purchase plan under which eligible financial institutions could sell preferred shares to the U.S. government. Financial conditions in emerging markets also worsened, with their exchange rates and equity prices generally falling and CDS premiums rising a bit on balance. Credit extended through the Federal Reserve's liquidity facilities decreased, owing, at least in part, to the recent improvement in short-term funding markets. The arrangement with the Bank of Canada is in the amount of $2 billion equivalent, and that with the Banco de Mexico is in the amount of $3 billion equivalent. Although the rise in hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector picked up slightly in the first quarter, the employment cost index decelerated further. Because these factors were not seen as likely to dissipate quickly, most participants judged that consumer spending would continue to be subdued for some time. In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, Committee members agreed that the stance of monetary policy should not be changed at this meeting. Declines in private payrolls slowed markedly in recent months, and, in the absence of the snowstorms, private employment probably would have risen in February. Real spending on equipment and software increased at a solid pace in the fourth quarter of 2009 and apparently rose further early in the first quarter of 2010. Growth in household spending has picked up recently but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Some limited easing of lending standards was noted for consumer loans, but credit availability remained a constraint and consumer credit continued to contract. Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index rose sharply in mid-February in response to events in the MENA region and remained somewhat elevated thereafter. Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans outstanding also increased, on balance, while the amount of nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding was little changed. On the one hand, labor market conditions were improving, though gradually, and the temporary cut in payroll taxes was contributing to rising after-tax incomes. The rise in consumer spending appeared to have slowed to a moderate rate in the first quarter from the stronger pace posted in the fourth quarter of last year. Real business investment in equipment and software (E&S) appeared to have increased more robustly in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter of last year. For concreteness, the Committee considered a set of specific principles that would guide its strategy of normalizing the stance and conduct of monetary policy. With home prices depressed, housing construction was quite subdued and seen as likely to remain so, while investment in nonresidential structures remained low. Broad stock price indexes were volatile but increased, on net, since the August FOMC meeting, following sharp declines in the days just preceding that meeting. Prices of money market futures contracts indicated that monetary policy was expected to become more accommodative in both the euro area and the United Kingdom. Market reaction to the announcements by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on November 15 regarding the expansion of the Home Affordable Refinance Program was limited. Consumer spending continued to advance, but business fixed investment appeared to be decelerating, and home sales and construction remained at very low levels. Inflation had declined from its rate earlier in the year, mainly reflecting lower prices of crude oil and gasoline, and inflation expectations had been stable. Both of these views would suggest a lower level of potential output and thus reduced scope for combating unemployment with additional monetary policy stimulus. Several participants noted the risk that continued high levels of unemployment, even if initially cyclical, might ultimately induce adverse structural changes. In part, the rise in inflation compensation may have reflected upward pressure on nominal Treasury yields associated with some unwinding of safe-haven demands. The fraction of seriously delinquent existing mortgages remained elevated, but the rate at which mortgages entered delinquency continued to trend down in July. Private nonfarm employment increased at a slightly faster rate in October and November than in the third quarter, but government employment decreased somewhat. Household spending has continued to advance, and the housing sector has shown further signs of improvement, but growth in business fixed investment has slowed. Although nominal new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft also increased markedly last quarter, the level of orders remained below shipments. Consumer energy prices declined in November and December, and survey data indicated that retail gasoline prices fell further in the first few weeks of January. In the euro area, industrial production and retail sales were below their third-quarter levels through November, and real GDP contracted in the United Kingdom. In addition, consumer sentiment improved over the intermeeting period, which some participants attributed to rising house prices and gains in the stock market. Reflecting these developments, participants' forecasts for the unemployment rate at this meeting were lower than those prepared for the September 2012 meeting. Conditions in the housing sector generally improved further, as real expenditures for residential investment continued to expand briskly in the second quarter. Participants generally continued to anticipate that the growth of real GDP would pick up somewhat in the second half of 2013 and strengthen further thereafter. In the market for commercial mortgage-backed securities, investor demand remained strong and spreads continued to be tight despite high issuance near year-end. The Committee's discussion of this topic was undertaken as part of prudent planning and did not imply that normalization would necessarily begin sometime soon. In particular, gains in equity values and home prices boosted household net worth, and real disposable personal income continued to rise in the second quarter. Meanwhile, business inventories generally appeared well aligned with sales, apart from the energy sector, where inventories remained below year-earlier levels. In response to a further downward surprise in the unemployment rate, the staff again lowered its forecast for the unemployment rate over the projection period. However, the dealers' expected levels of various employment and inflation indicators at the time of liftoff did not change materially from the previous survey. This approach was seen as consistent, given the Committee's assessment of the economic outlook at the current meeting, with the Committee's previous statement. At the request of any member of the Subcommittee, questions arising from such reviews and consultations shall be referred for determination to the Committee.7. In light of the uncertainties associated with the outlook for inflation, the Committee agreed that it would continue to monitor inflation developments closely. However, the outlook for business investment remained soft, and net exports were likely to continue to be restrained by the earlier appreciation of the dollar. Average hourly earnings for all employees increased 2-1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in September, a pace that was faster than consumer price inflation. As a result of the recently passed Bipartisan Budget Act, federal spending was expected to provide a modest boost to economic activity over the next few years. At the request of any member of the Subcommittee, questions arising from such reviews and consultations shall be referred for determination to the Committee.7. The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits was somewhat higher in early January than its very low level late last year. Consumer loan balances continued to rise at a robust pace in the fourth quarter, reflecting further expansions in credit card, auto, and student loan balances. The unemployment rate was expected to gradually decline further and to run somewhat below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period. A couple of participants pointed out that the recent decline in equity prices could be viewed as bringing equity valuations more in line with historical norms. The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits moved down in February and early March after increasing a little in January. Members noted the increase in inflation reported in recent months but expressed a range of views about the extent to which the increase would prove persistent. In its latest report on potential risks to the stability of the U.S. financial system, the staff continued to judge that vulnerabilities were moderate overall. The unemployment rate was expected to gradually decline further and to run somewhat below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period. Moreover, a number of participants cited reports from business contacts in their Districts of favorable credit conditions for household and business borrowers. Actions by investors to shift their portfolios away from very low-yielding foreign sovereign debt were cited as adding to the downward pressure on U.S. yields. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased briskly in June, but the increase for the second quarter as a whole was noticeably slower than in the first quarter. Market analysts also pointed to the communications and actions by advanced-economy authorities both before and after the vote as helping to reassure investors. As a consequence of Brexit, economic growth in the United Kingdom and, to a lesser extent, in the euro area would likely be slower than previously anticipated. Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, while market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low. While total assets under the management of MMFs changed little over the intermeeting period, investors continued to shift from prime funds to government funds. Economic activity in the second half of the year was expected to be buoyed in part by a pickup in business fixed investment and some rebuilding of inventories. In addition, conditions conducive to growth in consumer spending, such as a strong labor market or higher levels of household wealth, were expected to persist. Almost all participants saw the incoming data as consistent with an increase of 25 basis points in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting. In addition, the sharp decrease in the contribution to GDP growth from the change in inventory investment in the first quarter was not expected to be repeated. The economic expansions in Canada and the euro area as well as in China and many other emerging market economies (EMEs) continued to firm in the first quarter. Gross issuance of institutional leveraged loans was solid in April and May, al짯though it receded from the near-record levels seen over the previous two months. While delinquency rates on CRE loans held by banks edged down further in the first quarter, the delinquency rates on loans in CMBS pools continued to increase. Inflation measured on a 12-month basis had declined recently and, like the measure excluding food and energy prices, had been running somewhat below 2 percent. Yields on a broad set of money market instruments remained in the ranges observed since the FOMC increased the target range for the federal funds rate in June. Consumer sentiment in October, as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, was at its highest level since before the most recent recession. In particular, members noted that they would carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to the Committee's symmetric inflation goal. A few participants noted that a reduction in personal tax rates could potentially increase labor supply, but the magnitude of such effects was quite uncertain. A strengthening outlook for economic growth in the United States and abroad, along with recently enacted tax legislation, appeared to boost investor sentiment. Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12?몀onth percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), was 2 percent in March. Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12?몀onth percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), was 2 percent in April. European yields moved lower following a revision of the ECB's forward guidance at its June meeting concerning asset purchases and the path of short-term rates. Other participants judged that labor market conditions were tight, pointing to other data, including job quits and openings rates, and anecdotes from contacts. Contacts in the agricultural sector reported that conditions remain depressed, in part, due to the effects of trade policy actions on exports and farm incomes. Core PCE price inflation was expected to remain at 1.9 percent over this year as a whole and then to edge up to 2 percent for the remainder of the medium term. Furthermore, as they did not believe that these uncertainties would derail the expansion, they did not see further policy accommodation as needed at this time. Several participants raised concerns that measures of inflation expectations remained low and could decline further without a more accommodative policy stance. Participants judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong, with the unemployment rate at a 50?몑ear low and continued solid job gains, on average. The three-year-ahead measure from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Survey of Consumer Expectations edged up in February and remained in its recent range. Equity prices, sovereign yields, and the market-implied expected trajectory of the federal funds rate all plummeted, and the volatility of asset prices soared. Over the intermeeting period, foreign risk asset prices plummeted amid a rapid deterioration of investor sentiment due to the global spread of the coronavirus. Such an event could lead to more wide-ranging temporary shutdowns, with adverse implications for the production of goods and services and for aggregate demand. Much of the quarterly decline in trade volumes reflected a sharp drop in March due to weak demand globally and disruptions related to the coronavirus outbreak. Inflation was projected to weaken this year, reflecting both the deterioration in resource utilization and sizable expected declines in consumer energy prices. The decline in manufacturing production was widespread across all major industries and was led by a collapse in the output of motor vehicles and related parts. In addition, options for home equity extraction continued to be restricted, as credit for both home equity lines of credit and cash-out refinances was limited. Inflation was projected to weaken this year, reflecting both the deterioration in resource utilization and sizable expected declines in consumer energy prices. Following sharp declines, economic activity and employment had picked up somewhat in recent months but remained well below levels at the beginning of the year. Some market participants expected the Committee to eventually lengthen the weighted average maturity of the Federal Reserve's purchases of Treasury securities. Participants viewed accommodative monetary policy as also contributing to gains in durable goods and residential investment as well as the surge in home sales. The positivee vaccine news also supported risk sentiment abroad, leading many global equity price indexes to advance and the U.S. dollar to depreciate further. Triple-B-rated non-agency CMBS spreads came down substantially from their highs in the spring, although they remained elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. The staff would also monitor money market conditions on an ongoing basis to assess whether any additional adjustments were needed to the ON RRP facility terms. Long-term delinquencies remained elevated relative to recent years but were at levels significantly below those experienced during the Global Financial Crisis. They noted that a benefit of the outcome-based guidance was that it did not need to be recalibrated often in response to incoming data or the evolving outlook. Price increases were concentrated in relatively few items, suggesting that underlying inflationary pressures remained subdued amid considerable economic slack. Financing conditions for small businesses were little changed, with supply of small business loans remaining tight and demand still subdued outside of the PPP. Short-term funding markets were stable, while participation in the ON RRP facility increased further, to its highest level since the facility was put in place. Still, participants foresaw rapid growth this year, and several highlighted that the economy had shown resilience in the face of the recent wave of infections. Short-term funding markets were stable, while participation in the ON RRP facility increased further, to its highest level since the facility was put in place. Exports and imports of services edged up in October but remained low relative to pre-pandemic levels, largely because international travel was still depressed. Over the following two years, the boost to consumer prices caused by supply issues was expected to partly reverse, and energy prices were projected to decline. Increase the SOMA holdings of Treasury securities by $40 billion and of agency MBS by $20 billion, during the monthly purchase period beginning in mid-January. Consequently, market conditions would have to be monitored closely to determine the appropriate longer-run level of reserves and the size of the balance sheet. The staff's near-term projection for PCE price inflation was revised up relative to December in response to the anticipated slower resolution of supply issues. For agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), the Desk planned to continue to reinvest principal payments on a monthly basis through secondary-market purchases. Even so, participants judged that economic fundamentals remained solid and that they expected above-trend growth to continue, sustaining a strong labor market. Several participants commented on the challenges that monetary policy faced in restoring price stability while also maintaining strong labor market conditions. The credit quality of firms, municipalities, and households remained largely stable, although the outlook for credit quality had begun to deteriorate somewhat. The market-implied path of the federal funds rate indicated a peak policy rate of around 3.4 percent, significantly lower than at the time of the June meeting. Reflecting its financial stability objective, the Bank of England initiated a temporary gilt purchase program designed to address disorderly market conditions. The private-sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, moved lower, on net, from July to September but remained high. Delinquencies on residential mortgage loans continued to trend down, and the share of mortgages in foreclosure in August remained close to pre-pandemic levels. Real goods imports rose, driven by increases in imports of industrial supplies, which more than offset declines in imports of capital goods and consumer goods. Delinquencies on C&I loans stayed flat, and those on small businesses loans continued to edge up, but delinquencies remained low relative to historical levels. Foreign economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter, weighed down by the COVID-19-related slowdown in China and repercussions of Russia's war against Ukraine. In response to vulnerabilities at MMFs and open-end mutual funds, the Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed rules to make these funds more resilient. Participants agreed that cumulative policy firming to date had reduced demand in the most interest-rate-sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing. A number of participants observed that financial conditions had eased in recent months, which some noted could necessitate a tighter stance of monetary policy. With regard to labor costs, the twelve-month change in the employment cost index for private industry workers in September was well below its year-ago increase. In part, the pickup may have reflected an increase in business confidence as the economy proved resilient in the face of this year's substantial adverse shocks. Prices of precious and industrial metals, which had risen sharply since early March, particularly in May, reversed those gains later in the intermeeting period. The rise was led by a surge in liquid deposits and in retail money funds as investors adjusted their portfolios in response to the turmoil in financial markets. In response to rising energy prices, household survey measures of expectations for year-ahead inflation picked up in November and then edged higher in December. Spreads on conforming mortgage products also widened after reports of losses and reduced capital ratios at the housing-related government-sponsored enterprises. Recent readings on inflation generally were seen as slightly less favorable than in earlier months, partly due to upward revisions to previously published data. In the euro area, retail sales growth declined in October and November, and consumer and business surveys in November and December pointed to economic weakness. In their discussion of individual sectors of the economy, meeting participants emphasized that activity in housing markets had continued to deteriorate sharply. Some pointed out, however, that the fiscal stimulus package might not help in the near term, when the risks of a downturn in economic activity appeared largest. The output of utilities dropped back after a weather-related surge in January, while mining output fell somewhat in the first two months of the year on average. The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased at a somewhat more moderate rate in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter of 2007. Following the announcement, spreads on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt and on agency MBS narrowed, while share prices for their common and preferred stock fell. Demand for high-tech equipment appeared to have softened considerably, and spending on non-high-tech, non-transportation equipment was estimated to have fallen. However, conditions deteriorated in the secondary market for syndicated leveraged loans, with prices falling to new lows and bid-asked spreads widening notably. Participants noted that the financial turmoil had increasingly become an international phenomenon, leading to a marked deterioration in global growth prospects. Among the advanced foreign economies, headline equity price indexes generally fell significantly over the period, with the sharpest drops in the banking sector. Consumer outlays showed some signs of stabilizing at a low level, with real outlays for goods outside of motor vehicles recording gains in January and February. The staff raised its near-term estimate of core PCE inflation because recent data on core and overall PCE price inflation came in a bit higher than anticipated. Such spreads, however, remained somewhat wide for longer-dated issues, apparently reflecting concerns about volatility linked to mortgage-related hedging flows.\n"
